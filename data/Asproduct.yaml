Stretch fabric permits easy application. 6 x 8 inches. <br><br> <b>MediBeads Microwave Activated Moist Heat Wraps</b> are the first new heat therapy products for arthritis to deliver immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy to the joints and meet the criteria of an Ideal Analgesic Modality. <br><br> MediBeads are washable, odor-free, dust free, and will not support bacteria or fungal growth. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. <br><br> When microwaved, MediBeads draw moisture from the air and release it as clean, deeply-penetrating moist heat - no need to add water. <br><br> Because <b>MediBeads Wraps</b> are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the arthritic joints, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat to the arthritic joint for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. MediBeads recharge quickly and can be used again as necessary. <br><br> Through a patient pending process, the OrthoBeads in MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as \"clean moist heat\" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required. <br><br> When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (\"cooking\") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable. <br><br> Unique joint wrap designs offer excellent conformance to body contours while allowing full mobility during treatment. This portability enhances range of motion exercises and permits arthritis therapy to continue while \"on the go\".

The rubber grips are used on picks, probes, scalpels, modeling type knives and small hobby tools. Also use the EzGrip grip whenever repetitive motions are required to gain more precise control over the instrument used, and when small implements must be used over long periods of time. The Pen Grips feature an ergonomic design that is aimed at reducing grip pressure for people suffering from arthritis and carpal tunnel. This pen grip allows the use of one fingertip instead of three fingers. The unique design of this grip allows one finger to exert downward pressure for writing and no squeezing is necessary. The pen/pencil with the applied grip is held lightly without falling out or through the fingers.  <br><br> The Pen Grip greatly reduces grip forces needed to write. Can be used on a pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument. EZGrips are patented and have been awarded U.S. Utility and Design patents.  <br><br> EZGrip Pen Grips are especially helpful to persons with arthritis, cramping/dystonia, Carpal Tunnel and any type of grip impairment or for just plain comfort. They are used for finger stress relief as well as prevention of cramping, or other difficulties.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>EZGrip Pen Grips Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Material:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">hypoallergenic rubber compound, latex free.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Measurements:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">1 1/8 inch in length and 6/8 inch at widest point.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">package of 3 (one of each: red, white, blue) </FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"ezgrip-pen-grips.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"1","id":62,"image1":"/assets/images/ezgrip-1.jpg","image2":"/assets/images/ezgrip-5.jpg","image3":"/assets/images/ezgrip-4.jpg","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"ezgrip pen grips, pen grips, writing aid, pen and tool grip, add a grip, pencil grippers, arthritis writing aids, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","last_update":"2/26/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"ezgrip pen grips, pen grips, writing aid, pen and tool grip, add a grip, pencil grippers, arthritis writing aids, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\" \">","mfgid":"","minimumorder":"1","minorderpkg":"0","name":"EZGrip Pen Grips","nonsearchable":"0","nontax":"0","notforsale":"0","onsale":"0","outofstock_message":"","price":"2.95","price2":"0","price3":"0","price_1":"0","price_10":"0","price_2":"0","price_3":"0","price_4":"0","price_5":"0","price_6":"0","price_7":"0","price_8":"0","price_9":"0","pricing_groupopt":"0","qtydiscount_opt":"0","qtyoptions":"","realmedia":"","redirectto":"","related":"CMH3904,AMCPKTCK","reward_disable":"0","reward_points":"0","reward_redeem":"0","saleprice":"0","self_ship":"0","shipcost":"0","show_out_stock":"-1","sku":"ADT71120","sorting":"0","stock":"28","stock_alert":"0","tax_code":"","thumbnail":"/assets/images/ezgrip-1.jpg","title":"EZGrip Pen Grips :: easy to grip & promotes pain free writing","updated_at":"2012-05-21T02:55:51Z","usecatoptions":"0","userid":"Chris","weight":"0","width":"0"},{"accessgroup":"","accessories":"","backorder_message":"","catalogid":"1370","categories":"Around the House/Arthritis Writing Aids","categoryspecial":"0","cost":"0","created_at":"2012-05-21T02:55:51Z","date_created":"2/13/2012","depth":"0","description":"Helps neutralizes hand difficulties due to arthritis immediately.","display_stock":"","displaytext":"","distributor":"","eproduct_expire":"0","eproduct_instructions":"","eproduct_password":"","eproduct_path":"","eproduct_random":"0","eproduct_reuseserial":"0","eproduct_serial":"0","extended_description":"The design of the <b>EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen</b> allows writing to be comfortable and effortless. Using the ergonomic EzGrip\u00ae ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities \u2013 described as \u201c\u2026floating on paper,\u201d but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key \u2013 but lighter. The other fingers can just \"go along for the ride.\" It\u2019s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced. <br><br> The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or roller ball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly. <br><br> By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it\u2019s possible to never again get writer\u2019s cramp \u2013 never again contemplate the onset of any \"Itis\" \u2013 Tendonitis, Arthritis\u2026 or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI\u2019s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the \"miracle pen\" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately. <br><br> Here\u2019s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed. <br><br> The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways \u2013 with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure \u2013 even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It\u2019s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort. <br><br> <b>Uses Parker style refills.</b><!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Silver w/Navy Grip, soft rubber.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Ink:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Black.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Refills:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Uses Parker style.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"ezgrip-resq-gel-ergonomic-pen.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":63,"image1":"/assets/images/ResQPenHndFgr341w.gif","image2":"/assets/images/EzGri-_ResQ-Gel-Pen.gif","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"ezgrip gel pen, resq pen, ez grip pen, ezgrip resq ergonomic pen, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","last_update":"2/13/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"ezgrip gel pen, resq pen, ez grip pen, ezgrip resq ergonomic pen, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"The EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen is often called the miracle pen for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping.

The small size of the <b>Lighted Magnifying Tweezers</b> means they are handy for taking with you when you travel, or they can be kept easily in a purse or glove compartment.  <!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>Lighted Magnifier Tweezers - Discontinued Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Magnification</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">8 x</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"lighted-magnifier-tweezers.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":105,"image1":"/assets/images/lighted-magnifier-tweezer.jpg","image2":"","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"lighted tweezers, easy to grip tweezers, magnifying tweezers, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, arthritis handicap, arthritis disability, therapy utensils, tools, devices, aids, lighted magnifying tweezers","last_update":"2/13/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"lighted tweezers, easy to grip tweezers, magnifying tweezers, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, arthritis handicap, arthritis disability, therapy utensils, tools, devices, aids, lighted magnifying tweezers\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"Lighted, easy-to-grip, Magnifying Tweezers are the ideal solution for anyone who wants to see what they have been missing.

It may also be used as a prop to hold the gas filling nozzle open at gas pumps where the fill trigger detent is broken or missing. This is particularly useful during cold or inclement weather. <br><br> The <b>Gas Cap Gadget</b> is made from molded, black, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and features an ergonomic handle with a textured body. The wrench opening portion of the gas cap tool is hollowed out so that the gas cap tether won't interfere with it's operation. It is small enough to fit in your glove compartment, under you seat or even in some door map pockets. <br><br> Use to hold the fill nozzle open whenever you find a broken nozzle detente mechanism. Simply insert the fill nozzle into the filler neck of your car, squeeze the trigger to start the flow of gasoline, and then insert the flat portion of the Gas Gadget against the trigger and balance the round edge opposite the flat in the bottom portion of the nozzle. If not needed while filling, store the Gas Gadget on the access panel door. <br><br> Easy to use gas cap wrench assists in tightening gas caps.

Inside the tip is a rust proof metal washer made of zinc plated steel which prevents the cane or crutch from wearing through the tip.

A unique hook trigger allows you to hang the reacher by the trigger on a walker or wheelchair. It is easier to grip and lighter than other brands, making the Ergo Tek Plus\u2122 Reachers ideal for people with arthritis. An ergonomic designed textured handle and trigger allows the heel of the hand and fingers to be in a more natural position. <br><br> Only 8 oz of pressure is required at the trigger to close the jaws. The reacher jaw has a molded tip with interlocking groves to help improve grip force with clothing and other fabrics. A soft, slip-resistant santoprene molding over the jaw provides greater grip power and safely grasps larger objects more securely.

This microwavable hot or cold therapy mask is great for those suffering with sinus headaches. It may be used as a sleep aid to reduce excessive light for daytime sleeping. Place the gel mask in the freezer or refrigerator to be used for cold therapy for reducing swelling, numbing an area, or for pain relief. Warm the mask in the microwave, to use the gel mask for moist heat therapy. The warm, relaxing gel mask can help to stimulate blood circulation and relieve pain. The outside cover can be removed for washing. Universally sized (one size sinus mask fits most).<br><br> Elasto-Gel products from SouthWest Technologies are microwaveable hot/cold therapy products. More than 40 different sizes and shapes have been developed to literally apply hot or cold therapy to any part of the body. These products remain flexible even at temperatures of -20 degrees Farenheit. The product can be stored in the freezer to always have a flexible cold pack and yet be put directly into the microwave and heated to have a flexible instant hot pack (within 5 to 10 minutes). These gel packs stay hot or cold for 20-40 minutes. Many consumers have reported these products have durability of more than 10 years with hundreds of uses per year. Elasto-Gel products do not dry out, do not require rejuvenation by soaking in water, and will not leak if punctured. Do not allow the item to get wet. The gel will absorb water and swell. Elasto-Gel covers are made of a 4-way stretch material for maximum conformity and can be removed for washing.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>Elasto-Gel Sinus Mask Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Made in:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">USA.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Size:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Universal one size fits most.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Sinus gel mask, cover, strap.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"elasto-gel-sinus-mask.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":302,"image1":"/assets/images/ast301-sinus-mask-1w.jpg","image2":"/assets/images/ast301_Sinus-Mask_kid-1w.jpg","image3":"/assets/images/swt-leak-proof-logo.jpg","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"elasto-gel sinus mask, elastogel, sinus mask, gel mask, arthritis eye pain, arthritis sinus pain, sinus headache, moist heat therapy, microwave gel pack, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","last_update":"2/13/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"elasto-gel sinus mask, elastogel, sinus mask, gel mask, arthritis eye pain, arthritis sinus pain, sinus headache, moist heat therapy, microwave gel pack, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"The Elasto-Gel Sinus Mask is perfect for sinus pain relief.

The gel wrap is covered with a four-way stretch material which allows maximum conformity and comfort. <br><br> For moist heat treatment, heat the neck collar in the microwave or a conventional oven. Simply heat the pack according to the included directions. When a warm wrap is applied, heat quickly penetrates muscles and joints. For cold therapy, place the wrap in the freezer. The wrap will remain soft and flexible at temperatures as low a - 20 degrees F.

Thermoskin\u00ae supports with Trioxon\u00ae lining are completely washable and \u201cbreathable\u201d to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear.  <br><br> Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly. The arthritis ankle wraps are designed with an adjustable hook and loop closure to allow arthritis sufferers ease of use and compression variation. Hand washable. Item is non returnable. <br><br> Thermoskin Arthritis Ankle Wraps wrap around design is easier to put on.  Measure around ankle joint for proper fit.<!-- product-specs.html begins --><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"thermoskin-arthritis-ankle-wrap.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":329,"image1":"/assets/images/Ankle_Wrap_Arthritis.jpg","image2":"","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"thermoskin arthritis ankle wrap, arthritis ankle, ankle wrap, ankle support, arthritis joint pain, arthritis pain, arthritis aids, physical therapy products, ankle support, thermoskins, thermoskin joint support, thermoskin, rehab supplies, rehab products, therapy supplies, therapy accessories, rehabilitation supplies, ankle sleeve, arthritic ankle","last_update":"2/13/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"thermoskin arthritis ankle wrap, arthritis ankle, ankle wrap, ankle support, arthritis joint pain, arthritis pain, arthritis aids, physical therapy products, ankle support, thermoskins, thermoskin joint support, thermoskin, rehab supplies, rehab products, therapy supplies, therapy accessories, rehabilitation supplies, ankle sleeve, arthritic ankle\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"Thermoskin therapeutic Ankle Wrap supports are designed to provide compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit.\">","mfgid":"","minimumorder":"1","minorderpkg":"0","name":"Thermoskin Arthritis Ankle Wrap","nonsearchable":"0","nontax":"0","notforsale":"0","onsale":"0","outofstock_message":"","price":"32.95","price2":"0","price3":"0","price_1":"0","price_10":"0","price_2":"0","price_3":"0","price_4":"0","price_5":"0","price_6":"0","price_7":"0","price_8":"0","price_9":"0","pricing_groupopt":"0","qtydiscount_opt":"0","qtyoptions":"","realmedia":"","redirectto":"","related":"CHP501,ASPC7333","reward_disable":"0","reward_points":"0","reward_redeem":"0","saleprice":"26.95","self_ship":"0","shipcost":"0","show_out_stock":"-1","sku":"ATS8305","sorting":"0","stock":"16","stock_alert":"0","tax_code":"","thumbnail":"/assets/images/Ankle_Wrap_Arthritis.jpg","title":"Thermoskin Arthritis Ankle Wrap","updated_at":"2012-05-21T02:55:55Z","usecatoptions":"0","userid":"","weight":"0","width":"0"},{"accessgroup":"","accessories":"","backorder_message":"","catalogid":"1638","categories":"Getting Ready/Grooming and Hygiene Aids@Getting Ready/Toileting Aids","categoryspecial":"0","cost":"0","created_at":"2012-05-21T02:55:55Z","date_created":"2/13/2012","depth":"0","description":"Multipurpose, portable, personal hygiene aid.","display_stock":"","displaytext":"","distributor":"","eproduct_expire":"0","eproduct_instructions":"","eproduct_password":"","eproduct_path":"","eproduct_random":"0","eproduct_reuseserial":"0","eproduct_serial":"0","extended_description":"The <b>Freedom Wand</b> is a self wipe, sanitary, easy to use, multipurpose, portable, personal toilet tissue aid. It's specifically designed for personal cleaning and hygiene for anyone with limited mobility. <br><br> The Freedom Wand\u2122 comes in three pieces, the handle, the extension and the head. Use the Freedom Wand\u2122 with the handle and head for a total of 14 inches in length or add the extension for 21 inches. Because it's made from a polypropylene material, the freedom wand is very durable and easy to clean. <br><br> <b>The Head:</b> <br><br> The head is 9 inches long and has a slight curve to it to allow for proper reach. The head also has four \"fingers\" that extend out of the wand with the slide of a button. As they extend, they open to hold a shaver, sponge, ointment pad, tissue wad or other items. <br><br> When sliding the button back, the fingers go back into the wand, securing it in place and giving a tight grip, strength and a smooth end. To release an item, just push and slide the button back. It is that easy! The rinse hold in the head helps aid with cleaning in case any soil should get in the wand. <br><br> <b>The Extension:</b> <br><br> The extension is a 6\u00bd inch piece. When combined with the head and the handle, the wand becomes 21 inches long. If a shorter wand is desired, the head and the handle can be put together without the extension for a length of 14 inches. Both the extension and the handle have quick and easy release buttons. <br><br> <b>The Handle:</b> <br><br> The handle is approximately 8 inches long. It is contoured for ease in holding and has a soft secure grip to eliminate slipping. It also has a loop on the end so that you can hang it in a convenient spot. <br><br> This is a non-returnable hygiene item.<!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>Freedom Wand - multipurpose, portable, personal hygiene aid.

This award winning modular support system provides support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. The SuperPole has a high quality gripping surface that is particularly helpful for people with limited hand strength. It is constructed of heavy gauge steel for unfailing, rigid support. <br><br> SuperPole is a secure modular support structure that can be installed in minutes between a floor and ceiling and is held by a jack-screw expansion. The screw expands the pole to create enough tension between the floor and ceiling to hold the pole securely. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevent marring of the ceiling or floor. Installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Foam hand grip provides a comfortable gripping surface, particularly useful for those with limited hand strength. Installs anywhere there is a floor and ceiling, placing transfer support directly where it is needed. Use it beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair.  <br><br> Note: The SuperPole\u2122 System should only be installed between floors and ceilings of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System\u2122 should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings.

Pull sideways on the SuperBar to help you stand. The SuperBar unlocks and pivots freely to move with you step by step. This device locks every 45 degrees for stability during standing and sitting transfers. Automatically locks when released preventing forward or lateral falls. Provides full support when making two or three step transfers. <br><br> The SuperPole System is an award winning modular support system providing support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. This floor to ceiling grab bar installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevents marring of the ceiling or floor. <br><br> The SuperBar is a 16 inch horizontal center extension that mounts easily to the SuperPole for additional assistance. The Super Pole with Super Bar can easily be installed beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair. This transfer system is more compact than a walker in small restricted areas such as washrooms, and is ideal for pivot transfers in narrow areas such as between bed and wall, narrow hallways, etc. In a shower, the Super Pole with Super Bar provides complete support for stepping over the tub wall without reaching for wall grab bars. The SuperBar can pivot away from shower curtains, allowing them to fully close during a shower. For toilet transfers, the SuperBar permits pulling up to standing and can provide leaning support while managing clothing. <br><br> Please note: The SuperPole System should only be installed between floors and ceiling of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings. Recommended weight limit is 300 pounds. <!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>SuperPole System with SuperBar Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Material:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Heavy duty steel 1.5 inch diameter, 90 inches long.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Finish: </B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Anti-microbial powder coat white gloss finish.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Grip material: </B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Grey, premium high quality grip 20 inches long.

This is a toilet seat riser that you install only once and that blends in with the bathroom. It was created to solve the problems created by those old, clunky disabled toilet seats. <br><br> There have always been a range of handicapped and disabled toilet seats on the market. But until now, users of these toilet seat risers had to compromise their comfort and dignity. The old toilet seat risers were clunky, ugly and flimsy. They were unsanitary and hard to clean. And they were a pain to mount and remove after every use. In other words, there was plenty of room for improvement. <br><br> The Easy Toilet Riser requires little additional cleaning. But most importantly, the Toilet Riser\u2122 won\u2019t force you to change your bathroom experience. <br><br> There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You\u2019ll get to use the same toilet you\u2019re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser\u2122 just boosts it a little higher. <br><br> The Easy Toilet Riser\u2122 comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser\u2122 ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs. <br><br> Non returnable if packaging is opened. <br> <p> <a href=\"/assets/images/toilet-seat-riser-specs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/assets/images/pdf.jpg\" alt=\"Commode and Toilet Riser\" width=\"69\" height=\"77\" border=\"0\" />Commode and Toilet Riser Product Instructions</a> </p><!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>Commode and Toilet Riser Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Dimensions:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">21 \u00bc inches long x 11 \u00bd inches  wide x 4 inches high.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Elevation:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">4 inches.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">white.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Includes:</B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Toilet Seat Riser, two (2) 6 inch long closet bolts, two (2) wax rings, one (1) extended water pipe, two (2) washers, two (2) nuts, installation manual.</FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"commode-and-toilet-riser.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":509,"image1":"/assets/images/res_tolietriser.jpg","image2":"/assets/images/com_tolietriser.jpg","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"commode riser, raises commode, toilet riser, raises toilet, raise toilet, raise commode, for people with, arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, therapy, arthritis utensils, tools, devices, aids, arthritic","last_update":"2/13/2012","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"commode riser, raises commode, toilet riser, raises toilet, raise toilet, raise commode, for people with, arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, therapy, arthritis utensils, tools, devices, aids, arthritic\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"The Easy Commode and Toilet Riser is an easy to use handicapped toilet riser that raises the commode without any of the hassles that those old raised toilet seats created.

For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc. <br><br> An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way.  If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed. <br><br> The <b>Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc</b> is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper.  The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper.  The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer.  After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents. <br><br> Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc. <br><br> Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair:  The disc is \"locked\" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient.  The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer. <br><br> Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet:  Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers.  The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet. <br><br> Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed:  Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.

Fits over 170 million vehicles in North America. <br><br> The <b>HandyBar</b> locks securely, and reliably, into position to help you get in to and out of a car. In addition, it is easy to insert and remove, it is strong, durable and affordable. The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating. At just 0.7 lb., and measuring approx. 9 in. long, the Handybar\u2122 is sufficiently lightweight, and compact, for it to be carried around in a handbag or pack. The precisely shaped nose locks the Handybar\u2122 securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily. It is also cranked, or bent, over its length to enable it to be reversed to give just the right height and angle of grip for getting in and out of a vehicle. Smaller, more compact cars tend to be lower down, closer to the ground making it even more difficult to get in and out of them. Fortunately, the U-type striker plate is one of the most rugged components in a vehicle being designed to keep the door closed in the event of a side-impact crash. There is a striker on each of the door pillars enabling the Handybar\u2122 to be used by both the driver and passengers. <br><br> Stainless steel bar with non-slip hand grip fits in space where car door latches. Provides secure assist in getting in and out of a car. Easy to store and carry. Includes seat belt cutter and side window breaker.

The patented, hands-free, automatic illumination is the only personal visual aid that knows when to turn itself on and off.  <br><br> Simply flip the on/off switch to the on position, clip the light to round tubing of a cane, walker or rollator and start moving. Three bright LED lights are powered by two AAA batteries (included). The light uses two sensors. First, a motion sensor determines movement. After 30 seconds of not being moved, the light turns off. Second, the light uses a lighting sensor to determine if it is in a low level light environment. Only when it is in a low light environment and in use will the light illuminate. Saves batteries and time.

This medical grade silicone gel will not dry out, rot,  flow or leak if cut or punctured. Dimensions gel provides protection from shearing and friction, is specifically designed to reduce pressure, impact, and vibration and remains pliable and soft when used in extreme temperatures. Because the gel does not absorb fluids, it is ideal for use in places where the pad might get wet.

8 inch Round Pads</b> are great for holding things firmly and securely in place, allowing the elderly, arthritic and disabled to perform everyday tasks. The non-slip material grips on both sides to secure objects, and still removes easily. Non toxic non-slip mats can be used on tables or trays to keep plates, cutlery, cups, pens or pencils from rolling. Holds a plate, bowl or glass secure, as well as reduces spillages while enabling people to retain their independence by feeding themselves. <br><br>  Mats are available in blue, red, and yellow. Color contrast is important for many partially sighted, elderly people because the contrast helps to make items easier to see against work surfaces. Placing a brightly colored Dycem mat under a bowl will help make it easier to see as well as making the bowl more stable. The Dycem yellow has been endorsed for visually impaired by the Royal National Institute of Blind People. <br><br> Dycem mats are ideal for one handed activities. When the pads become dirty and dusty, simply restore the non-slip properties by washing in warm soapy water and allowing to dry. <br><br><b>Dycem non-slip mats are not effective when wet.</b><!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t<P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t<h4>Dycem Non-Slip 8 inch Round Mats Specifications:</h4>\t</FONT>\t</P>\t<TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\">\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Size: </B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">8 inch diameter. </FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t<TR VALIGN=\"TOP\">\t\t<TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Colors: </B></FONT></TD>\t\t<TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Blue, Yellow or Red. </FONT></TD>\t</TR>\t\t</TABLE>\t<P><!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"dycem-non-slip-8-inch-round-mats.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"0","id":599,"image1":"/assets/images/DycemRounds-1.jpg","image2":"/assets/images/DycemRoundBlue-2.jpg","image3":"/assets/images/dycemroundblue.jpg","image4":"","imagecaption1":"","imagecaption2":"","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"dycem 8 inch round pad, dycem round mat, dycem, non slip mats, non-slip mats, dining aid, no slip mat, one handed aids, no spill aid, non slip pad, coaster that grips, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products","last_update":"2/29/2012 8:22:21 AM","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META name=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"dycem 8 inch round pad, dycem round mat, dycem, non slip mats, non-slip mats, dining aid, no slip mat, one handed aids, no spill aid, non slip pad, coaster that grips, for people with, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, elderly, seniors, handicap, disability, arthritis, arthritic, therapy, utensils, tools, devices, aids, products\"><META name=\"description\" CONTENT=\"Dycem 8 inch Round Pads are great for holding things firmly and securely in place.

Simply insert the sock over the rubber tabs, and pull the sock onto your foot. <br><br> This easy to use sock aid will work with sports socks, knee hi nylons, and many types of knee-hi compression stockings. <br> <!-- product-specs.html begins -->\t <P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">\t\t <h4>Sock Horse Sock Aid Specifications:</h4></FONT></P>\t <TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\"><TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Measures:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">18 x 4 x 6 inches.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Weight:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">0.3 lbs.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Taupe.</FONT></TD></TR>\t\t <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Made In:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">USA.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"sock-horse.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"1","id":664,"image1":"assets/images/meu274-sock-horse-2.jpg","image2":"assets/images/mey274-sock-hhorse-4.jpg","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"Sock Horse Sock Aid","imagecaption2":"Sock Horse Sock Aid","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"","last_update":"5/9/2012 1:25:29 PM","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META NAME=\"DESCRIPTION\" CONTENT=\"The Sock Horse Sock Aid helps you put on your socks quickly and easily and does not stretch out the stock.

Think of it as a stand-up trowel and multi-purpose gardening tool. No more burned out drills or bent and broken trowels. People of all ages, and those with disabilities find this landscaping tool easy to use. <br><br> The Planting Stick digs a round hole at the right depth and width which forms the perfect hole for planting. This gardening tool is designed to punch holes in difficult soils, such as wet soils, clay soils, ground covered by a thin layer of gravel or landscape fabric. <br><br> The Planting Stick\u2019s shaft and auger are made of steel. At the crook, a foam handle cushions the turning crank. A plastic bearing inserted inside the foam handle keeps it from slipping down the shaft while turning. Topping it off is an easy to grip neoprene ball mounted on stainless steel ball-bearings. This adapted gardening tool is assembled using welded-steel construction, therefore there is nothing that can bend or break, and it is durable enough to last for many growing seasons. By turning the foam handle clockwise while pressing down on the ball, the auger will corkscrew into the ground to dig a planting hole. <br><br> The Planting Stick also handles other garden chores such as weeding, turning the compost bin and starting holes for posts with ease. <br> <!-- product-specs.html begins --> <P><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"> <h4>The Planting Stick:</h4></FONT></P> <TABLE CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" BORDER=\"0\"><TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Length:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">45 inches long.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Weight:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">8 pounds.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Color:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Red.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Materials:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">Steel, foam rubber, neoprene.</FONT></TD></TR> <TR VALIGN=\"TOP\"><TD><IMG WIDTH=\"24\" SRC=\"/assets/images/spacer.gif\" HEIGHT=\"12\" BORDER=\"0\"></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Made In:</B></FONT></TD> <TD><FONT FACE=\"Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif\" SIZE=\"2\">USA.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <!-- product-specs.html ends -->","extra_field_1":"","extra_field_10":"","extra_field_2":"","extra_field_3":"","extra_field_4":"","extra_field_5":"","extra_field_6":"","extra_field_7":"","extra_field_8":"","extra_field_9":"","filename":"planting-stick.html","fractional_qty":"0","free_shipping":"0","giftcertificate":"0","height":"0","hide":"0","hide_1":"0","hide_10":"0","hide_2":"0","hide_3":"0","hide_4":"0","hide_5":"0","hide_6":"0","hide_7":"0","hide_8":"0","hide_9":"0","homespecial":"1","id":665,"image1":"assets/images/planting-stick.png","image2":"assets/images/ags300-planting-stick-2.jpg","image3":"","image4":"","imagecaption1":"The Planting Stick","imagecaption2":"The Planting Stick","imagecaption3":"","imagecaption4":"","instock_message":"","keywords":"","last_update":"5/9/2012 10:50:28 AM","listing_displaytype":"1","loginlevel":"-1","manufacturer":"","maximumorder":"0","metatags":"<META NAME=\"DESCRIPTION\" CONTENT=\"The Planting Stick helps prepare the perfect planting hole.
