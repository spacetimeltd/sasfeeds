Fits over 170 million vehicles in North America.The Auto Handy Bar Transfer Aid device locks securely, and reliably, into position. In addition, it is easy to insert and remove, and it is strong, durable and affordable. The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating. At just 0.7 lb., and measuring approx. 9 in. long, the Handybar\u2122 is sufficiently lightweight, and compact, for it to be carried around in a handbag or pack. The precisely shaped nose locks the Handybar securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily. It is also cranked, or bent, over its length to enable it to be reversed to give just the right height and angle of grip for getting in and out of a vehicle. Smaller, more compact cars tend to be lower down, closer to the ground making it even more difficult to get in and out of them. Fortunately, the U-type striker plate is one of the most rugged components in a vehicle being designed to keep the door closed in the event of a side-impact crash. There is a striker on each of the door pillars enabling the Handybar to be used by both the driver and passengers.Includes seat belt cutter and side window breaker. Weight limit 350 lbs.

Unique to Thermoskin\u00ae is Trioxon\u00ae?a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskins\u00ae are completely washable and ?breathable? to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products.Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while helping to retain heat. With Thermoskins, users experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly. The arthritis wraps are designed with an adjustable hook and loop closure to allow arthritis sufferers ease of use and compression variation. Measure circumference of arm just below the elbow, with arm extended to determine size. Thermoskin Arthritis Elbow Wrap Features: Ideal for mildly increasing skin temperature to give increased circulation around the elbow for relief of pain and discomfort from arthritis, Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI), and tendonitis. Inner lining made of Trioxon, a unique fiber that wicks away perspiration and keeps skin ventilated and comfortably dry. Adjustable Velcro strap applies additional compression/support when needed. Hand or machine-washable.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"For Your Comfort","MerchantGroup":"Thermoskin Joint Supports","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Therapeutic Gloves, Wraps, and Supports","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"ASN506","SearchTerms":"","ShortDescription":"","Status":"instock","StoreID":"1","Subcategory":"183","UPC":"","URL_to_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/250x1000/therarelwrap.jpg","URL_to_product":"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/therarelwrap.html","URL_to_thumbnail_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/100x500/therarelwrap.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:48Z","id":337,"name":"Thermoskin Arthritis Elbow Wrap","price":"29.95","updated_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:48Z"},{"AddToCartURL":"","Bestseller":"","Category":"12","Commission":"","CompareTo":"","CompatibleWith":"","CrossSell":"","Custom_1":"","Custom_2":"","Custom_3":"","Custom_4":"","Custom_5":"","Description":"This specially designed Wanchik's Writer device slides comfortably on, wrapping around your hand between the thumb and the index finger.

Simply by tipping the Provale cup in a normal drinking motion, 5 or 10 cc of liquid is delivered. By returning the cup to its upright position, the chamber is refilled and ready to deliver another 5 or 10 cc. The Provale cup encourages normal drinking habits and small swallows. May help eliminate the need for pre-thickened liquids with some patients with dysphagia. Nose clearance minimizes head tilt. Easy to disassemble for cleaning. The Provale cup is dishwasher safe. Patented anti-suck mechanism prevents over-delivery of fluids. Transparent Outer Cup model allows liquid activity monitoring. Use with or without provided handles. Dishwasher safe.The advantages The PROVALE\u00ae Drinking Cup are: *Delivers a fixed delivery amount of liquid with every normal drinking motion. The New PROVALE\u00ae Cup's ease of use may allow for more patient independence. Because individual patient needs vary, a trained healthcare professional must make the decision on patient independence. *Patented mechanism prevents over-delivery of fluid. Unlike a \"sippy\" cup, The New PROVALE Cup has a patented feature that prevents over-delivery of fluid when the cup is used properly. Sucking on the drinking spout will not result in additional fluid being dispensed.*Good nose clearance to minimize head tilt. The Cup-In-A-Cup design of The PROVALE Cup provides very good nose clearance which allows patients to keep their chin in a proper position to make a good swallow. The inner or middle cup contains an angled channel that also allows the user to keep their chin in a good position for a proper swallow.*Can be used with water, nutritional supplements, and some thickened liquid products. *Optional one or two easy-grip-handle or no-handle design. *Travel-mug appearance is functional, yet inconspicuous. The PROVALE\u00ae Cup is designed with patient integrity in mind. *Designed to utilize normal drinking motion.*Easy and logical to assemble.*Easy-to-clean and institutional dishwasher-safe. No valves or tubes to clean. *Broad base to minimize tipping and spilling.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"In the Kitchen","MerchantGroup":"","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Cups, Glasses and Straws","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"CRM","SearchTerms":"provale, provale cup, the provale cup, metered drinking cup, cup for dysphagia, swallowing disorders, swallowing problems, for the disabled, handicapped, elderly, seniors, physically impaired","ShortDescription":"Encourages normal drinking habits and small swallows.New cup for people with swallowing difficulties.","Status":"instock","StoreID":"1","Subcategory":"183","UPC":"","URL_to_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/250x1000/provalecup.jpg","URL_to_product":"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/provalecup.html","URL_to_thumbnail_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/100x500/provalecup.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:49Z","id":421,"name":"PROVALE\u00ae Cup","price":"39.95","updated_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:49Z"},{"AddToCartURL":"","Bestseller":"","Category":"12","Commission":"","CompareTo":"","CompatibleWith":"","CrossSell":"","Custom_1":"","Custom_2":"","Custom_3":"","Custom_4":"","Custom_5":"","Description":"Constructed of woven cotton fabric.

This moist heat wrap rests gently on the top of the shoulders and base of the neck. Deeply penetrating moist heat helps restore muscles to a relaxed and natural healthy state. Because MediBeads Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. Through a patent pending process, MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as \"clean moist heat\" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required. When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase (\"cooking\") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable. MediBeads Neck Rest Features: Natural moist heat for pain relief. Clean, deeply-penetrating moist heat - no need to add water. Washable, odor-free, dust free, and will not support bacteria or fungal growth. Shape drapes easily and comfortably conforms to the top of the shoulders and neck area.

Metal splint positioned at 25 degrees helps prevent wrist movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Fully adjustable velcro locking straps adjusts for a better fit. Thermoskin Thermal Supports contain the exclusive patented Trioxon lining that has been clinically proven to increase your surface and subcutaneous skin temperature 2 to 3\u00b0 F. This helps increase the elasticity of muscles, tendons, and ligaments to reduce the risk of injury when under stress. Thermoskin Thermal Supports also increase the blood flow to damaged tissue to help speed up the healing process, while providing light compression to counteract tissue swelling. The spiral structure of the Trioxon lining creates a micro-climate which allows the skin to ventilate by wicking away moisture and does not close the pores of the skin. You can wear Thermoskin for extended periods of time without the discomfort you would have with other products. Competitive products trap the perspiration resulting in discomfort, risk of infection and unpleasant odor. In a recent study Thermoskin Thermal Supports provided ?Considerable Relief? or ?Total Relief? of pain in 83% of patients. Measure the circumference of the hand around the knuckles.

Nearly 10% of the public suffers from this form of depression when deprived of precious sunshine. Now, the original Verilux HappyLight can be yours ? delivering a full 10,000 LUX of indoor light therapy without any harmful UV rays. And it can be hung on a wall or set on a table or counter for your morning sunshine bath.Research Findings:Follow-up Study shows 94% of patients stopped using anti-depressant drugs. While correct diagnosis of SAD has become more commonplace, treatment is the area where doctors and SAD sufferers need more education. In the past, doctors have been quick to prescribe an anti-depressant (like Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) when a patient mentioned being ?depressed?. While drugs can sometimes be effective treating depression, they also have a well documented history of very serious side-effects. Light therapy is the natural, side-effect free alternative to anti-depressant pills.To illustrate, a 1997 research study titled ?Follow-up study of seasonal affective disorder in Switzerland?, conducted at the Psychiatric University Clinic, Basel, Switzerland, concluded that:?Over a number of years, the clinical diagnosis changed for the better in 64% of the patients? and that light therapy (and perhaps also light-oriented behaviour) reduced the incidence and depth of subsequent depressive episodes. Further evidence for this was the large reduction in use of conventional antidepressant drugs (from 17 to 1) during the follow-up period. Diagnosis of SAD was stable and reliable.?

Composed of a durable, specially weighted rubber compound, great care was taken to control the right amount of flexibility, giving the base its remarkable performance. Stairs are now easily managed. Quad canes need to be turned sideways on stairs, making the user uncomfortable and in some cases fearful. The AbleTripod\u00ae gives the user confidence to negotiate even the narrowest steps. The stress of impact on the user's hand is greatly reduced by the AbleTripod\u00ae Base , which flexes as you walk. The tips of the pods flex, grabbing while permitting the AbleTripod\u00ae to roll through, maintaining contact with the ground. The stability of the AbleTripod\u00ae base is not compromised whether on grass, gravel or sand , whereas typical canes may sink into the ground. The AbleTripod\u00ae Walking Cane Tip can be used in ways that no other cane can: its unique design enables the user to lean into the cane, experiencing both support and balance. The ability to lateralize gives the user a unique feeling of confidence, knowing that the AbleTripod\u00ae is less likely to slip out than quad canes. The patented AbleTripod\u00ae Base easily replaces your walking cane tip, addressing all of these issues and more. The base comes in 4 standard-size openings: 5/8\", 3/4\", 7/8\", 1\" and 11/16\" **See Diagram below for proper fit.** AbleTripod Walking Cane Tip Features: Adds maximum stability and function to your cane.

Its innovative shape has a balanced handle that provides stability and comfort. This design enables you to more easily cut food by using a rocking motion on the gently curved outside tines.This knife and fork combo utensil is also recognized as a daily living aid for people with limited hand mobility-- from temporary injuries such as sprains to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis. It can be invaluable to individuals with no use of one hand due to conditions such as hemi-paralysis and amputations. The Knork\u00ae has been implemented in rehabilitation centers and hospitals around the country. Individuals who would otherwise require that their food be cut for them-- or else greatly limit their meal choices-- can gain greater independence and freedom by using this remarkable eating tool. Knork Features: The Head: The Knork's outer tines are curved and beveled, creating rounded cutting edges that are not serrated or even sharp to the touch. This utensil is as safe to the mouth as a standard fork. The curved shape enables the head to be rocked back and forth in a motion that is very much like that of a rocking chair. It is the combination of the beveled edge and the rocking motion that gives the Knork\u00ae its amazing cutting ability. The Finger Platform: The Knork\u00ae has an enlarged finger platform located between the handle and head. When trying to cut foods using a regular fork, the finger can develop a painful \"indentation\" from pressing down on the side of the narrow handle or tines. When using the Knork\u00ae, the finger rests on the smooth, comfortable platform. It also reduces the effort needed to rock the head back and forth, creating the cutting motion. As a result, the Knork\u00ae can cut through tougher foods such as pizza. Contoured Handle: An enlarged, rounded end gives the Knork\u00ae enhanced leverage, balance and stability. It is designed to be equally easy to use with either the right or left hand. The Knork is 100% forged 18/10 stainless steel which makes it durable, and dishwasher safe.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"In the Kitchen","MerchantGroup":"Knork Silverware","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Adaptive Eating Utensils","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"CK0","SearchTerms":"","ShortDescription":"The knork cuts through food with a rocking motion which is facilitated by a finger platform on both sides of the handle.

Longer length will accommodate patients and transfers in areas where space is not an issue. This model has been used successfully in boosting or repositioning patients in bed. The \"No-Lift\" Frictionless BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer System BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. Versatility The design of the BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"On The Move","MerchantGroup":"BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Transfer Discs, Slides and Boards","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"111411","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"CBE1100","SearchTerms":"","ShortDescription":"Longer length will accommodate patients and transfers in areas where space is not an issue.","Status":"instock","StoreID":"1","Subcategory":"183","UPC":"","URL_to_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/250x1000/orbetrbo.jpg","URL_to_product":"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/orbetrbo.html","URL_to_thumbnail_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/100x500/orbetrbo.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:51Z","id":602,"name":"Original BeasyTrans Transfer Board","price":"209.95","updated_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:51Z"},{"AddToCartURL":"","Bestseller":"","Category":"12","Commission":"","CompareTo":"","CompatibleWith":"","CrossSell":"","Custom_1":"","Custom_2":"","Custom_3":"","Custom_4":"","Custom_5":"","Description":"Lightweight Easy Grip Scissors are ideal for people with decreased hand strength.

It?s the CPAP Multi-Mask Sleep Aid .The American Sleep Apnea Association identifies CPAP therapy as the most common treatment for sleep apnea. CPAP therapy works by preventing the airway from closing during sleep. It is administered at bedtime through a nasal or facial mask held in place by velcro straps around the patient?s head. The mask is connected by a tube to a small air compressor. The CPAP machine sends air under pressure through the tube and into the mask, where it imparts positive pressure to the upper airways, preventing the tissues in the back of the throat from collapsing during sleep.This is an extremely effective form of treatment when used in compliance with doctors orders. However, non-compliance is a big issue. It has been estimated that over 65% of patients use the machine for a maximum of just 4 hours per night when it should be used for the duration of the patient?s sleep. Additionally, many patients report using the CPAP for just a few nights out of the week. Discomfort is a major factor contributing to non-compliance. During side sleeping or stomach sleeping, the mask presses and rubs against the patient?s face, which leads to discomfort and can also distort the mask, causing leaks and exacerbating the problem of non-compliance. CPAP Sleep Aid Pillow Features: Improves mask comfort. Freedom of movement during sleep. Multi-position sleeping for side, back and stomach sleepers. Neck support and spinal alignment. Reduces mask leaks. Mask pressure on face. Airway resistance due to better neck support. CPAP Sleep Aid Pillow Specifications: 20L X 13W x 4H.

May be used for independent transfers with professional approval. Many facilities use this system for boosting patients in bed. The \"No-Lift\" Frictionless BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer System BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. Versatility The design of the BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"On The Move","MerchantGroup":"BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Transfer Discs, Slides and Boards","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"111412","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"CBE1200","SearchTerms":"","ShortDescription":"Perfect for smaller areas, like bathroom transfers.","Status":"instock","StoreID":"1","Subcategory":"183","UPC":"","URL_to_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/250x1000/beasyii.jpg","URL_to_product":"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/beasyii.html","URL_to_thumbnail_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/100x500/beasyii.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:52Z","id":620,"name":"Beasy II","price":"199.95","updated_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:52Z"},{"AddToCartURL":"","Bestseller":"","Category":"12","Commission":"","CompareTo":"","CompatibleWith":"","CrossSell":"","Custom_1":"","Custom_2":"","Custom_3":"","Custom_4":"","Custom_5":"","Description":"Protect your investment with a custom fitted Cover for the Contour CPAP Pillow .This case is 75% cotton, 25% polyester and it's custom designed with Velour and Quilted panels to provide a snug fit.

Studies show Alzheimer patients increase food intake by 24% and liquid by 84% due to red color. The Redware Tableware - Deluxe Set includes sectioned scoop dish with lid, Inner Lip plate, cup, fork and spoon. Basic Set includes scooper dish with nonskid base, cup, fork and spoon.People who have Alzheimer?s disease experience impairments not only in their cognitive abilities but also in their physiological status. Approximately 40% of Alzheimer?s patients experience significant weight loss. This weight loss may be due to many different factors but a study out of Boston University suggests that significant weight loss is due in part to the loss of the ability to distinguish contrast between colors.People with Alzheimer's are not able to distinguish light colored food and drink on or in typically light colored tableware. When using tableware that offered a high contrast to the food and drink (i.e.: bright red and bright blue), researchers noticed that the participants in the study increased their food intake by 24% and liquid intake by 84%.

For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc.An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way. If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed.The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper. The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper. The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer. After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents.Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc.Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair: The disc is \"locked\" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient. The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer.Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet: Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers. The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet.Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed: Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.For better control and safety, always have the patient wear a transfer belt. 18 inch Safety Sure Transfer Disc Specifications: Weighs 2 pounds. 18 inch diameter. 1/2 inch thick.

Also facilitates caregiver?s natural transfer motions. Seat and base are same diameter. The \"No-Lift\" Frictionless BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer System BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans\u2122 Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! Tissue Friendly - Elimination of Skin Friction It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. Versatility The design of the BeasyTrans\u2122 Easy Transfer Systems make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment. For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients.Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.","ISBN":"","Manufacturer":"The Wright Stuff, Inc.","MerchantCategory":"On The Move","MerchantGroup":"BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board","MerchantID":"942","MerchantSubCategory":"Transfer Discs, Slides and Boards","MerchantSubgroup":"","Option1":"","Option2":"","Option3":"","Option4":"","Option5":"","PartNumber":"111413","QuantityDiscount":"","ReservedForFutureUse1":"","ReservedForFutureUse2":"","ReservedForFutureUse3":"","ReservedForFutureUse4":"","ReservedForFutureUse5":"","ReservedForFutureUse6":"","ReservedForFutureUse7":"","ReservedForFutureUse8":"","ReservedForFutureUse9":"","Retail_Price":"","ReviewsRSSURL":"","SKU":"CBE1300","SearchTerms":"","ShortDescription":"Easiest way to transfer a patient!","Status":"instock","StoreID":"1","Subcategory":"183","UPC":"","URL_to_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/250x1000/beasyglyder.jpg","URL_to_product":"http://www.wrightstuff.biz/beasyglyder.html","URL_to_thumbnail_image":"http://feeds2.yourstorewizards.com/1931/images/100x500/beasyglyder.jpg","created_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:52Z","id":645,"name":"BeasyGlyder","price":"204.95","updated_at":"2012-05-20T23:25:52Z"},{"AddToCartURL":"","Bestseller":"","Category":"12","Commission":"","CompareTo":"","CompatibleWith":"","CrossSell":"","Custom_1":"","Custom_2":"","Custom_3":"","Custom_4":"","Custom_5":"","Description":"The Clear Flip Away Wheelchair Armrest Tray is made of sturdy, transparent polycarbonate for a clear line of sight to lap and legs.

Today is Tuesday, you have had a good breakfast and taken all of your medication. Mary is here with you, and I will be back this afternoon.\" A message like this, or a simple \"I love you, Mom\", played on demand, can calm and reassure someone who is often anxious and confused. The Kind Reminder\u2122 was created by the daughter of someone who is an Alzheimer's patient. It is a recorder specifically designed for people with dementia. It may be worn as a pendant or placed on a nearby table or counter. It is compact, lightweight, and easy to operate - just press the one big visible button to hear a caring message.

The Video for Alzheimer's Patients contains pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th century brings back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. In the fall of 2007, my mom asked if I would help keep track of her checking account. She expressed a fear of making a serious financial mistake because she had been forgetting to write entries in her ledger. My mother had never missed a payment, successfully balancing her checkbook to her 80th year. But there she was, asking me for help. This thoroughly independent lady painfully relinquished control of her finances. As time went on, she had to give up more and more control as she experienced a number of strokes and the onslaught of Alzheimer's. By the end of 2008, she could no longer live independently and moved into an assisted living facility. The doctors told her she had Alzheimer's/Dementia for a number of years, which was taking a toll on her health. She was in and out of hospitals five times in her last year. One of the hospitals provided a television channel with 24/7 videos and music. We watched for hours, and I quizzed her on the flowers and trees on the television. You see, I am a landscape designer with a background in horticulture. My mom got me interested in plants at a young age. She helped me get a job at a local nursery when I was 13 years old. One day in the hospital, I thought about using the thousands of flower photographs I have taken over the years to make a DVD video for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementia. The pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th Century bring back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. The video is 60 minutes long and has over 400 high-quality images of flowers. Some pictures include birds, bees or butterflies. The music consists of classics such as America The Beautiful, Shine On Harvest Moon, Just A Closer Walk, A Bicycle Built For Two, Amazing Grace, and God Be With You Till We Meet Again. My mother lost her battle with Alzheimer's in June of 2009, but her legacy lives on through the video by helping others appreciate the beauty of God's creation.

Using the ergonomic EzGrip\u00ae ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities ? described as ??floating on paper,? but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key ? but lighter. The other fingers can just \"go along for the ride.\" It?s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced.The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or rollerball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly.By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it?s possible to never again get writer?s cramp ? never again contemplate the onset of any \"Itis\" ? Tendonitis, Arthritis? or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI?s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the \"miracle pen\" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately. Here?s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed.The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways ? with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure ? even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It?s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort. Uses Parker style refills. EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen Features: Clinically tested ergonomic design. EzGrip pen helps reduce writing fatigue. Requires up to 57% less pressure than standard pens. EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen Specifications: Pen color: silver w/ navy grip, soft rubber. Ink color: black.

Healthcare professionals are increasingly recognizing obesity as a risk factor for diabetes and associated complications, including heel pressure ulcers. Heelift\u00ae Bariatric Suspension Boot helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in patients who are particularly prone to suffer from the condition. Specifically, Heelift Bariatric was developed for patients weighing up to 600 pounds who have a calf circumference of between 12 to 23 inches. Like Heelift Standard, Heelift Bariatric offloads the heel by redistributing pressure from the heel to the patient's calf. The design of Heelift Bariatric minimizes contact between the patient's leg and objects that can cause pressure at the heel or at folds in the skin. Rounded, adjustable straps and a smooth, friction-free tricot backing also ensure that the Heelift will not rub against or cause impressions on the patient's other leg. Together with diligent care and monitoring, Heelift Bariatric can help even the most at-risk patients prevent heel pressure ulcers. Boot is non-returnable if packaging is opened. Heelift Bariatric Suspension Boot Features: Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture. \"Easy-on, easy-off\" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro\u00ae straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs. Friction-free tricot backing: Unlike other suspension products, which can have sharp edges on the back that can rub against the patient's other leg, Heelift is manufactured with a smooth tricot backing that aids in patient mobility and helps ensure patient safety. Smooth foam: Heelift Bariatric is available in Smooth foam only. Smooth foam is ideal for patients with edematous legs as it will not create \"impressions\" on the leg. Ventilation holes: Ventilation holes provide additional air circulation to promote increased patient comfort. Tricot covered stiffener: This feature prevents Heelift from buckling for added patient comfort and safety. The Heelift features forefoot support using a spring back technology to keep the foot upright. The Heelift can be autoclaved for sterilization. Close the straps and place in a normal autoclave wrapper. The Heelift can be machine-washed and dried. Simply tighten the straps and enclose in a net laundry bag or a pillow case.

Specifically, Heelift\u00ae Petite works best for patients ranging in height from 3'10 to 5'4 and whose calf circumferences measure 6 to 10 inches. Children, just like adults, are at risk for heel pressure ulcers if they are stationary for long periods of time due to health conditions or multihour surgery. Heelift Petite, together with turning and careful monitoring of the skin, can aid in preventing pressure ulcers in these young patients. Boot is non-returnable if packaging is opened. Heelift Petite Smooth Suspension Boot Features: Shorter length proximal to the heel: To accommodate short patients, the length of Heelift Petite is shorter than Heelift Standard. Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture. \"Easy-on, easy-off\" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro\u00ae straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs. Friction-free tricot backing: Unlike other suspension products, which can have sharp edges on the back that can rub against the patient's other leg, Heelift is manufactured with a smooth tricot backing that aids in patient mobility and helps ensure patient safety. Smooth or Convoluted foam: Heelift Petite is available in either Smooth or Convoluted foam. Smooth foam is ideal for patients with edematous legs as it will not create \"impressions\" on the leg. Convoluted foam is slightly cooler to wear. Ventilation holes: Ventilation holes provide additional air circulation to promote increased patient comfort. Tricot covered stiffener: This feature prevents Heelift from buckling for added patient comfort and safety. The Heelift features forefoot support using a spring back technology to keep the foot upright. The Heelift can be autoclaved for sterilization. Close the straps and place in a normal autoclave wrapper. The Heelift can be machine-washed and dried. Simply tighten the straps and enclose in a net laundry bag or a pillow case.

When you stand from the typical recliner, it tilts forward, dropping the arms and seat of an already low chair by 3 - 4 inches. Simply raising the chair by 5 or 6 inches, necessary for independent standing, makes it dangerously unstable. When Recliner Risers are installed, they raise a chair 1 \u00be inches and limit the forward tilt allowing an additional 3 - 4 inches of lift. The 4 - 6 total inches of extra support gives a weakened person a biomechanical advantage and enables them to stand on their own. Recliner Risers attach quickly and easily to the wooden base of your favorite recliner. Our patented design raises your effective seat height 4 - 6 inches while only raising your chair 1 \u00be inches. The Riser helps give your chair a lift. Standers Recliner Riser Features: Makes standing or sitting easy. Does not interfere with rocking or reclining of chair. Slip resistant and non-marking pads protect floor. Installs quickly with included wood screws. Matches look and feel of furniture. Limits forward tilt to make standing safe and easy. Standers Recliner Riser Specifications: Riser Dimensions: 1.75 inches high x 2.5 inches wide x 6 inches long. Weight Capacity: 800 lbs (including furniture).

The non-slip material grips on both sides to secure objects, and still removes easily. Great for holding things firmly and securely in place, allowing the elderly, arthritic and disabled to perform everyday tasks. Holds a plate, bowl or glass secure, as well as reduces spillages while enabling people to retain their independence by feeding themselves. Dycem mats are ideal for one handed activities.

For people with muscle control issues, hand ailments, severe arthritis or similar conditions, successful self feeding can be a real challenge. All scooper plates have a slightly taller rim on one side that has a reverse curve. The curve helps in scooping food onto a utensil. As food is pushed into this curve, it naturally rolls back onto a spoon or fork. Higher edges around the rest of the plate help corral foods and reduce the opportunity for spills. Scoop dishes are suitable for both adults and children. However, they are typically smaller than regular dinner plates, which is ideal for better portion size control. The Blue Scooper Dish is made of a darker blue plastic and the dark blue background provides high contrast for light color foods which may not be easily identified on white plates by persons with declining vision (a frequent occurrence with Alzheimer's patients). The Blue Scooper Plate diameter is 6 \u00be inches and has a circular shape. The edges are curved and half inch high with a one inch high reverse curve for scooping food. The bottom has a one-quarter inch rim. The scoop plate is molded of heat-resistant blue plastic and is dishwasher safe. The Blue Scooper Plate is also available with a suction cup base.

Made to specifically mold to the cervical neck region, this wrap can provide either hot or cold therapy relief for the neck and upper spine areas. This neck brace is made of a tough yet soft, flexible gel that is covered with a four-way stretch, soft lycra material. This allows for maximum conformity, heat transfer, and comfort. For moist heat treatment, heat the neck collar in the microwave or a conventional oven. Simply heat the pack according to the included directions. When a warm wrap is applied, heat quickly penetrates muscles and joints. Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar continues to provide heat for an estimated 20 to 30 minutes before reheating becomes necessary. For cold therapy, place the wrap in freezer. The wrap remains soft and flexible at temperatures as low as -20 degrees F. Usually the cold wrap will numb the treated area within 5 minutes without the harsh shock and pain that is sometimes experienced with ice or ice water treatments. The wraps will remain cold for approximately 20 to 40 minutes. Store the Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar in the freezer until ready to use. Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar Features: Microwaveable. Will not leak if punctured. Will not dry out. Conforms to cervical spine curves. Indestructible gel, cover and strap are all latex-free. For Hot or Cold therapy treatment.

This sock aid has rubber grips that help to pull the sock over the heel and up the calf. Unlike other sock aids, your sock will not slip off the Sock Horse Sock Aid. The rubber grips are smooth and do not snag delicate socks or stockings. Simply insert the sock over the rubber tabs, and pull the sock onto your foot. The Sock Horse does not stretch out socks like other sock aids because the sock is not stretched over the outside of the sock aid. By loading the sock onto the inside of the Sock Horse, with just the top of the sock over the tabs, your socks are not stretched out and your skin never touches the plastic. The easy to grip handle has ribbed thumb grips and contoured finger grips. This easy to use sock aid will work with sports socks, knee hi nylons, and many types of knee-hi compression stockings. Sock Horse Sock Aid Features: Long easy to grip handle. Does not stretch out socks. Easy to load for those with weaker hands. Skin never touches the hard plastic.

This gardening tool is designed to punch holes in difficult soils, such as wet soils, clay soils, ground covered by a thin layer of gravel or landscape fabric. Difficult planting situations in between shrubs or tree roots are no problem for The Planting Stick. Think of it as a stand-up trowel and multi-purpose gardening tool. No more burned out drills or bent and broken trowels. People of all ages, and those with disabilities find this landscaping tool easy to use. The Planting Stick?s shaft and auger are made of steel. At the crook, a foam handle cushions the turning crank. A plastic bearing inserted inside the foam handle keeps it from slipping down the shaft while turning. Topping it off is an easy to grip neoprene ball mounted on stainless steel ball-bearings. This adapted gardening tool is assembled using welded-steel construction, therefore there is nothing that can bend or break, and it is durable enough to last for many growing seasons. By turning the foam handle clockwise while pressing down on the ball, the auger will corkscrew into the ground to dig a planting hole. The Planting Stick also handles other garden chores such as weeding, turning the compost bin and starting holes for posts with ease. The Planting Stick Features: Instantly digs the perfect hole.

It was designed by a wife who disliked the way her husband?s gastronomy tube was constantly being taped to his body. The G-Tube Belt eliminates the need for clumsy pins and tape, and is by far the most comfortable way to secure all types of enteral feeding tubes including PEG tubes, gastrostomy tubes, and jejunostomy tubes. The G-Tube Belt increases the user?s level of tube control, helps to increase self-care, and helps to minimize the risk of accidental pull-out by combative patients and small children. Using the G-Tube Belt should be done after consultation with a physician. It is recommended that a sterile drain sponge with slit for tube entry be placed against the skin as a buffer. Wrap waist strap around waist and secure to a comfortable fit using the hook and loop closure for adjustment. Slide tube through slit to pouch and position pouch over tube accordingly. Secure tube while not in use by coiling onto pouch face and then close bottom flap securely over tube coil. Care Instructions: G-Tube Belt flannel center pouch and soft elastic fabric waistband are conveniently machine washable. Hand or machine wash with a mild disinfectant and hang dry. Be sure to engage the hook and loop fasteners before washing to prevent lint accumulation. G-Tube Belt Features: Secures Peg Tubes, G-tubes, and most other enteral feeding tubes. Soft, comfortable elastic waist band. Washable and reusable. Eliminates need for pins and tape. G-Tube Belt Specifications: Material: Latex free.
