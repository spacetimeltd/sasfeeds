The rubber grips are used on picks, probes, scalpels, modeling type knives and small hobby tools. Also use the EzGrip grip whenever repetitive motions are required to gain more precise control over the instrument used, and when small implements must be used over long periods of time. The Pen Grips feature an ergonomic design that is aimed at reducing grip pressure for people suffering from arthritis and carpal tunnel. This pen grip allows the use of one fingertip instead of three fingers. The unique design of this grip allows one finger to exert downward pressure for writing and no squeezing is necessary. The pen/pencil with the applied grip is held lightly without falling out or through the fingers.   The Pen Grip greatly reduces grip forces needed to write. Can be used on a pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument. EZGrips are patented and have been awarded U.S. Utility and Design patents.   EZGrip Pen Grips are especially helpful to persons with arthritis, cramping/dystonia, Carpal Tunnel and any type of grip impairment or for just plain comfort. They are used for finger stress relief as well as prevention of cramping, or other difficulties.

Using the ergonomic EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities – described as “…floating on paper,” but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key – but lighter. The other fingers can just ""go along for the ride."" It’s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced.  The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or roller ball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly.  By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it’s possible to never again get writer’s cramp – never again contemplate the onset of any ""Itis"" – Tendonitis, Arthritis… or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI’s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the ""miracle pen"" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately.  Here’s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed.  The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways – with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure – even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It’s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort.  Uses Parker style refills.			EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen Specifications:									Color:		Silver w/Navy Grip, soft rubber.

Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the elbow and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.  Unique to Thermoskin® elastic supports is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear. Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin, patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated.

Clinically tested Thermoskin® therapeutic supports provide compression while helping to control arthritis swelling and aiding in the stability of the shoulder.  Thermoskin® supports are made from fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit.  Unique to Thermoskin® supports is Trioxon® - a special soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® Supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear.   Thermoskin Shoulder Wrap out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated.

Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the hand and wrist and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.  Unique to Thermoskin® elastic supports is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear.  Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly.

Thermoskin Arthritis Knee Wrap is universal to fit both left and right.  To size, measure leg circumference under slightly bent kneecap. Clinically tested-Thermoskin® therapeutic elastic supports provide compression while helping to control arthritis swelling and aiding in the stability of the knee.  Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the knee and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.

Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products.

Comfortable, firm support for weak, injured or aching wrists. Helps prevent and provide relief of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Added benefit of heat therapy. Relieves pain and inflammation. Anatomically conforming fit and shape allows full use of fingers. Outer layer of fabric is textured to provide additional grip to aid in daily living activities. Metal splint positioned at 25 degrees helps prevent wrist movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Fully adjustable velcro locking straps adjusts for a better fit.  Thermoskin Thermal Supports contain the exclusive patented Trioxon lining that has been clinically proven to increase your surface and subcutaneous skin temperature 2 to 3° F. This helps increase the elasticity of muscles, tendons, and ligaments to reduce the risk of injury when under stress. Thermoskin Thermal Supports also increase the blood flow to damaged tissue to help speed up the healing process, while providing light compression to counteract tissue swelling. The spiral structure of the Trioxon lining creates a micro-climate which allows the skin to ventilate by wicking away moisture and does not close the pores of the skin. You can wear Thermoskin for extended periods of time without the discomfort you would have with other products. Competitive products trap the perspiration resulting in discomfort, risk of infection and unpleasant odor.  In a recent study Thermoskin Thermal Supports provided “Considerable Relief” or “Total Relief” of pain in 83% of patients.

It's specifically designed for personal cleaning and hygiene for anyone with limited mobility.  The Freedom Wand™ comes in three pieces, the handle, the extension and the head. Use the Freedom Wand™ with the handle and head for a total of 14 inches in length or add the extension for 21 inches. Because it's made from a polypropylene material, the freedom wand is very durable and easy to clean.  The Head:  The head is 9 inches long and has a slight curve to it to allow for proper reach. The head also has four ""fingers"" that extend out of the wand with the slide of a button. As they extend, they open to hold a shaver, sponge, ointment pad, tissue wad or other items.  When sliding the button back, the fingers go back into the wand, securing it in place and giving a tight grip, strength and a smooth end. To release an item, just push and slide the button back. It is that easy! The rinse hold in the head helps aid with cleaning in case any soil should get in the wand.  The Extension:  The extension is a 6½ inch piece. When combined with the head and the handle, the wand becomes 21 inches long. If a shorter wand is desired, the head and the handle can be put together without the extension for a length of 14 inches. Both the extension and the handle have quick and easy release buttons.  The Handle:  The handle is approximately 8 inches long. It is contoured for ease in holding and has a soft secure grip to eliminate slipping. It also has a loop on the end so that you can hang it in a convenient spot.

The Leg Loop™ consists of two loops - a hand loop and a foot loop, one at each end of a rigid middle section.  The Leg Loop Leg Lift helps people with limited lower extremity strength lift the leg and foot. It is designed to help people who have medical conditions in which they either partially or completely lose the ability to independently move their leg. Paraplegia, hemiplegia, paraparesis, hip surgery, and knee surgery are fairly common examples.  The foot loop stays open until the strap is pulled and then conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable grip. Rigid middle section allows for easy maneuverability. Once pulled, the loop closes and conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable fit.

This is a toilet seat riser that you install only once and that blends in with the bathroom. It was created to solve the problems created by those old, clunky disabled toilet seats.  There have always been a range of handicapped and disabled toilet seats on the market. But until now, users of these toilet seat risers had to compromise their comfort and dignity. The old toilet seat risers were clunky, ugly and flimsy. They were unsanitary and hard to clean. And they were a pain to mount and remove after every use. In other words, there was plenty of room for improvement.  The Easy Toilet Riser requires little additional cleaning. But most importantly, the Toilet Riser™ won’t force you to change your bathroom experience.  There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You’ll get to use the same toilet you’re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser™ just boosts it a little higher.  The Easy Toilet Riser™ comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser™ ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs.

For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc.  An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way.  If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper.  The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper.  The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer.  After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents.  Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc.  Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair:  The disc is ""locked"" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient.  The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer.  Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet:  Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers.  The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet.  Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed:  Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.  (For better control and safety, always have the patient wear a transfer belt.  Safety Sure Transfer Disc weighs 2 pounds and is 12 inch thick. Weight limit 300 lbs.
