10	|	Description	|	Designed to deliver a moist heat treatment when it's convenient to just lie back in bed or sit in a comfortable chair. The size works well for treating shoulders, lower back, and abdomen. This size also gets the bed cozy and warm on winter nights. 9 x 12 inches.  MediBeads Microwave Activated Moist Heat Wraps are the first new heat therapy products for people with arthritis to deliver immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy and meet the criteria of an Ideal Analgesic Modality.  MediBeads are washable, odor-free, dust free, and will not support bacteria or fungal growth. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate.  When microwaved, MediBeads draw moisture from the air and release it as clean, deeply-penetrating moist heat - no need to add water.  Because MediBeads Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain or arthritis, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. MediBeads recharge quickly and can be used again as necessary.  Through a patient pending process, the OrthoBeads in MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as "clean moist heat" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required.  When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase ("cooking") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.  Unique wrap designs offer excellent conformance to body contours while allowing full mobility during treatment. This portability enhances range of motion exercises and permits therapy to continue while "on the go". Natural hydration eliminates messy sponges, cloths or towels.  MediBeads Wraps are an excellent value and aid arthritic joints. They are well-constructed of specially chosen materials and, with proper use, will give many years of service.

10	|	Description	|	MediBeads Microwave Activated Moist Heat Sinus Wraps are the first new heat therapy products to deliver immediate pain relieving moist heat therapy and meet the criteria of an Ideal Analgesic Modality.  MediBeads are washable, odor-free, dust free, and will not support bacteria or fungal growth. Unlike other grain and pellet products, MediBeads need no special covers, they will not dry out, dissolve or disintegrate.  When microwaved, MediBeads draw moisture from the air and release it as clean, deeply-penetrating moist heat - no need to add water.  Because MediBeads Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the sinus area, relief begins immediately. The wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat to the sinus area for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. MediBeads recharge quickly and can be used again as necessary.  Through a patient pending process, the OrthoBeads in MediBeads continuously recharge by absorbing only water molecules from the air. Adding water is not necessary. The absorbed water is held, purified and released as "clean moist heat" when the MediBeads Wrap is microwaved. The result is a bacteria and odor-free wrap. MediBeads Wraps are washable, so no special covers are required.  When removed from the microwave, the temperature of MediBeads Wrap does not increase. This prevents inadvertent burns, which are caused by the continued temperature increase ("cooking") prevalent in all gel packs. Microwave activation eliminates potentially dangerous use of boiling water, electricity or ovens. MediBeads are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, easy to use and portable.  Unique MediBeads Sinus Wrap designs offer excellent conformance to body contours while allowing full mobility during treatment. This portability enhances range of motion exercises and permits therapy to continue while "on the go". Natural hydration eliminates messy sponges, cloths or towels.  MediBeads Sinus Wraps are an excellent value. They are well-constructed of specially chosen materials and, with proper use, will give many years of service.

10	|	Description	|	The MediBeads Foot Wrap is designed to provide hot or cold therapy to tired, aching ankles and feet. Because the MediBeads Foot Wraps are ready for use in just a minute and are applied directly to the site of pain, relief begins immediately. The foot wraps continue to deliver therapeutic moist heat to the feet for up to thirty minutes. This is the medically recommended treatment time for heat therapy within a three to four hour period. MediBeads recharge quickly and can be used again as necessary.  Medibeads safely deliver a clean moist 20 minute heat treatment when microwaved for only 60 seconds. They take their moisture from the air, so it is not necessary to add water. Medical professionals recommend moist heat because it penetrates deeply and quickly to increase blood flow to reduce pain and relax muscles. Alternatively, Medibeads can be put in the freezer to provide cold therapy when it is desired.			MediBeads Foot Wrap:: Hot or Cold Therapy Specifications:									Sold as:		a pair.							Fits up to:		men's size 12.							Measures:		5W  X  13L inches.

Quick, deep-penetrating relief from arthritis pain, joint stiffness and muscle aches is just a spray away.  Unlike pain pills they take up to 20 minutes to act, this aloe-based, all-natural pain reliever - applied directly to the source of pain - works in seconds. Use with MediBeads Heat Wrap Products to enhance absorption. Odorless, stainless, grease less and irritation free.  HTA's all-natural ingredients include:  Aloe Vera: A natural first-aid gel and anti-inflammatory that penetrates deeply while moisturizing and soothing. Chamomile: An all-natural anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial that has a soothing and calming effect on the skin.  Everlasting: A natural anti-inflammatory agent and analgesic sometimes used in the treatment of eczema and psoriasis.  Buckthorn: A moisturizing treatment used for dry skin disorders and to reduce skin damage caused by sunburn.  Allantoin: A skin protectant, conditioning agent and cell proliferant that assists in the formation of new skin tissue.

10	|	Description	|	The EZGrip Pen Grips can be attached to or can replace existing grips on any pen, pencil or pencil-like tool for ease of use. The rubber grips are used on picks, probes, scalpels, modeling type knives and small hobby tools. Also use the EzGrip grip whenever repetitive motions are required to gain more precise control over the instrument used, and when small implements must be used over long periods of time. The Pen Grips feature an ergonomic design that is aimed at reducing grip pressure for people suffering from arthritis and carpal tunnel. This pen grip allows the use of one fingertip instead of three fingers. The unique design of this grip allows one finger to exert downward pressure for writing and no squeezing is necessary. The pen/pencil with the applied grip is held lightly without falling out or through the fingers.   The Pen Grip greatly reduces grip forces needed to write. Can be used on a pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument. EZGrips are patented and have been awarded U.S. Utility and Design patents.   EZGrip Pen Grips are especially helpful to persons with arthritis, cramping/dystonia, Carpal Tunnel and any type of grip impairment or for just plain comfort. They are used for finger stress relief as well as prevention of cramping, or other difficulties.

10	|	Description	|	The design of the EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen allows writing to be comfortable and effortless. Using the ergonomic EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities – described as “…floating on paper,” but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key – but lighter. The other fingers can just "go along for the ride." It’s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced.  The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or roller ball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly.  By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it’s possible to never again get writer’s cramp – never again contemplate the onset of any "Itis" – Tendonitis, Arthritis… or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI’s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the "miracle pen" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately.  Here’s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed.  The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways – with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure – even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It’s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort.  Uses Parker style refills.			EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen Specifications:									Color:		Silver w/Navy Grip, soft rubber.

10	|	Description	|	The Maddox Professional Helper Knife is a rocker knife designed for use by individuals with upper extremity disabilities or use of only one hand. This knife requires predominantly downward pressure and minimal rocking motion to cut. The knife has a weighted blade with a hollow ground 440 stainless steel edge. The knife is designed on a vertical axial plane design that provides control when pushing down, limiting slippage and increasing force.  The tall wood and epoxy handle keeps hands and fingers suspended above the cutting area and the groove notch at the top provides a thumb index centering the hand above the blade for single hand use. In addition, the handle provides sufficient surface area for two hands to clasp the sides of the handle and generate cutting force. The knife includes a snap-on, snap-off Kydex sheath for transport and storage.                            			Maddox Professional Helper Knife Specifications:									Dimensions:		6.25 inches long and the handle is 4.25 inches tall.							Weight:		5.1 ounces.

The device incorporates a large button-hook, a small button-hook, a zipper pick, and a closed loop buttoning aid, all of which fold into a pocket-knife-style handle. The zipper pick functions as a zipper pull and can be used to free a buried zipper tab or untie knotted shoelaces.  A spring-tensioned design secures the tools to the handle and allows for wear over time. A loop on the handle aids in grasping the device. All four tools are manufactured from fully-hardened 301 stainless steel and will flex slightly and maintain their original shape. Open triangles above each tool are consecutively indexed to allow identification by touch or feel. A pocket clip is included to secure the tools in a pocket or purse.                                                            			Blue PocketDresser :: Buttonhook, zipper pull, and button aid.

10	|	Description	|	The Flexible Finger Control Grips help provide better grip control when using small hand tools.  The grips attach to your tools using high strength elastic to wrap around the handle and hook and loop (Velcro) closure. To attach the grips, lay your tool on a flat surface, hold one side of the grip, then wrap (stretch) the elastic finger grip around your tool and press the hook and loop closure (Velcro) together tightly on the handle. Then you just leave it on the handle permanently if you want. Water, dirt, oil, or soap does not hurt the Finger Grips.  The Flexible Finger Control Grips can be used to:  Attach to the handles of needle nose pliers, regular pliers, wire cutters, wrenches, etc. You can use them on small handle garden tools such as pruning shears, hand cultivators, hand trowels, etc. They can even be used on thicker handle kitchen utensils, such as, large serving spoons, spatulas and thick handle arthritic dinner table utensils.  Tired of dropping your tools when working in tight places or because the tool becomes slippery, then you need Flexible Finger Control Grips.  3 different sizes of Flexible Finger Control Grips are available: small to medium, large, and extra large.  Small to Medium  fits handles 1 ½ to 2 inch diameter around the handle. ( metal to thin rubber coated handles on pliers, needle nose, wire cutters, etc.) Large fits handles 2 to 2 ½ inch diameter. (thicker rubber coated on many of the newer pliers, needle nose pliers, etc.) Extra Large fits handles 2 ½” to 3 ½ inch diameter.(small garden hand tools, thick handle kitchen utensils, etc.)  Use a flexible tape measure to measure the handles and determine the size you need.

10	|	Description	|	The Lace-Amatic is the perfect gadget for you if it is difficult for you to lace and tie your shoes every time you go outside. This small two-part plastic mechanism acts as a ratchet to tighten up pre-tied shoes allowing users to slip on their shoe and tighten it without retying a bow every time. The lace-amatic slips over the shoe's laces and once twisted, it tightens the laces just like tying them.  Designed to help people with reduced mobility, the lace-amatic is ideal for people with arthritis, autistics, the elderly, single hand and arm amputees, ALS, MS, Parkinson's, post op hip and knee surgery, pregnancy, stroke, bad backs, overweight and hand or arm joint injury. The lace-amatic can help make bending down to tie up their shoes a less difficult task.  			Lace-Amatic Specifications:									Material:		clear polycarbonate plastic.							Weighs:		only - 11 grams (0.38oz).

Simply fit sock over device and use padded handles on long cords to pull on with ease.  The two foam handles provide a large diameter gripping surface for those with limited grasp due to arthritis. Flexible plastic sock aid is lined with nylon fabric on the inside that allows the foot to “slide” into the sock. Terry cloth outer cover provides a non-slip resistance to the sock which helps prevent the sock from slipping off the sock aid before it is snug.

10	|	Description	|	The Peta Long Reach Garden Tools are specially designed for gardeners who have to sit on a chair or stool while gardening due to arthritis for other disabilities. It is strongly recommended that an interchangeable plug-in arm support is used with these tools which not only allows the strength of the forearm to be used but also acts as a counter balance.  All metal parts are stainless steel and the grip is soft PVC vinyl.  The Long Reach Cultivator is shown in the picture with the added Arm Support Cuff.

The Arthritis Thumbs Up Cup is a lightweight and durable insulated plastic cup designed for people with limited strength or coordination. Finger joints can be used to their greatest mechanical advantage because of two backward tilt handles and thumb rests.  The clever design provides extra hand control and leverage when tipping the cup to drink. The unique design of the handles also allows the cup to be raised to the lips without wrist motion.   The double-walled insulated cup protects hands from heat and cold. The Arthritis Thumbs Up Cup can be used with hot or cold liquids. Cup holds 8 ounces with an extra inch at the top to reduce spills. Liquid ounce and metric markings inside allow portion control and easy fluid intake monitoring. Cup comes with a removable, spouted lid.   Microwave safe and top-rack dishwasher safe.

Simply clip the Autodrop to the top of the eye drop container after the cap has been removed. The Autodrop will then fit right over the eye, and a special lip holds the lower lid down to prevent blinking. Unique pinhole directs eyesight upward and away from the descending drops.  Autodrop Eye Drop Guide can be used in conjunction with the Autosqueeze Eye Drop Bottle Squeezer #AMI209.

10	|	Description	|	The Long Loop Easi Grip Scissors have been designed to help overcome difficulties encountered by those with weak hand or grip conditions that make the use of conventional style scissors uncomfortable or impossible.  Using the index finger to provide guidance and control, the middle, ring and little fingers are inserted through the loop to provide the strength for the cutting action. Alternatively for those with very limited movement the fingers can be placed over the long loop. Gently squeeze the scissors shut, the spring-action of the handle will automatically reopen the scissors as soon as the grip is eased.  Recommended for Weak Grip or for Poor Hand Control.			Long Loop Easi Grip Scissors Specifications:									Blade:		3 inch Pointed Stainless steel blades.							Color:		blue for right handed, green for left handed.

The unique design and bright yellow color enable wheelchair users and their caregivers to more readily locate the grips.   Products like Accu-Grips™ do not currently exist on the market. Because the product developer worked directly with wheelchair users throughout her career as a health care provider, she noticed that the majority of her patients had difficulty seeing or feeling the original grips on their wheelchairs. Her committment to her patients and her willingness to solve this challenge led to the development of Accu-Grips™.

The use of this material makes them extremely durable and provides for an excellent grip both indoors and outdoors.  Safety is enhanced because the tread pattern at the bottom of the tip does not wear as quickly as a conventional tip. Inside the tip is a rust proof metal washer made of zinc plated steel which prevents the cane or crutch from wearing through the tip. The "tire track" treads at the point of contact provide an excellent grip on most surfaces.  The convex bottom enhances both walking comfort and durability. This cane tip has a patented elastic neck which adjusts to the dimension of the cane or crutch shaft, making it easy for the user to replace tips as needed.  Tip fits canes and crutches with common dimensions of 5/8" - 7/8".  Black.			Ingrid Classic Cane/Crutch Tip - Medium Specifications:									Construction:		high quality polyurethane.

10	|	Description	|	The Ingrid Classic Cane/Crutch Tip is extremely durable and provides for an excellent grip both indoors and outdoors. The tips are manufactured in Sweden and made of high quality polyurethane.   Safety is enhanced because the tread pattern at the bottom of the tip does not wear as quickly as a conventional tip. Inside the tip is a rust proof metal washer made of zinc plated steel which prevents the cane or crutch from wearing through the tip. The "tire track" treads at the point of contact provide an excellent grip on most surfaces.   The convex bottom enhances both walking comfort and durability. This cane tip has a patented elastic neck which adjusts to the dimension of the cane or crutch shaft, making it easy for the user to replace tips as needed.

10	|	Description	|	ErgoTek Plus Reachers help make grasping out of reach objects easier. A unique hook trigger allows you to hang the reacher by the trigger on a walker or wheelchair. It is easier to grip and lighter than other brands, making the Ergo Tek Plus™ Reachers ideal for people with arthritis. An ergonomic designed textured handle and trigger allows the heel of the hand and fingers to be in a more natural position.  Only 8 oz of pressure is required at the trigger to close the jaws. The reacher jaw has a molded tip with interlocking groves to help improve grip force with clothing and other fabrics. A soft, slip-resistant santoprene molding over the jaw provides greater grip power and safely grasps larger objects more securely. The ErgoTek Plus Reachers jaws open to 3 1/4 inches for grasping larger objects, such as 15 oz cans.  A D shape jaw, pulling post and a magnet in the tip end of the reacher provides greater versatility.  ErgoTek  Plus™ Folding Reacher jaw can be rotated 90 or 180 degrees allowing vertical objects to be grasped while keeping the hand, wrist and forearm in a natural position. Optional folding model collapses flat, allowing more convenient placement in wheelchair backpacks, walker baskets. Folded length is 13.5 inches, extended length is 26 inches. Weighs 6.35 oz.

Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the elbow and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.  Unique to Thermoskin® elastic supports is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear. Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin, patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly. The arthritis elbow wraps are designed with an adjustable hook and loop closure to allow arthritis sufferers ease of use and compression variation. Hand washable. Item is non returnable.  Thermoskin Arthritis Elbow Wrap:  This easy to pull on elbow wrap is ideal for people suffering from arthritis or tennis elbow. Helps to provide relief from pain and discomfort by retaining body heat yet keeps skin dry. Hand washable. Measure circumference of arm just below the elbow to determine size.

10	|	Description	|	The Elasto-Gel Sinus Mask is a gel therapy mask designed for relief of sinus headaches, sinus infections or post eye surgery. This microwavable hot or cold therapy mask is great for those suffering with sinus headaches. It may be used as a sleep aid to reduce excessive light for daytime sleeping. Place the gel mask in the freezer or refrigerator to be used for cold therapy for reducing swelling, numbing an area, or for pain relief. Warm the mask in the microwave, to use the gel mask for moist heat therapy. The warm, relaxing gel mask can help to stimulate blood circulation and relieve pain. The outside cover can be removed for washing. Universally sized (one size sinus mask fits most). Elasto-Gel products from SouthWest Technologies are microwaveable hot/cold therapy products. More than 40 different sizes and shapes have been developed to literally apply hot or cold therapy to any part of the body. These products remain flexible even at temperatures of -20 degrees Farenheit. The product can be stored in the freezer to always have a flexible cold pack and yet be put directly into the microwave and heated to have a flexible instant hot pack (within 5 to 10 minutes). These gel packs stay hot or cold for 20-40 minutes. Many consumers have reported these products have durability of more than 10 years with hundreds of uses per year. Elasto-Gel products do not dry out, do not require rejuvenation by soaking in water, and will not leak if punctured. Do not allow the item to get wet. The gel will absorb water and swell. Elasto-Gel covers are made of a 4-way stretch material for maximum conformity and can be removed for washing.			Elasto-Gel Sinus Mask Specifications:									Made in:		USA.							Size:		Universal one size fits most.							Includes:		Sinus gel mask, cover, strap.

10	|	Description	|	Walk with confidence with the contemporary looking Metro Walker, one of the most compact, collapsible, portable, easy to open and close Walkers available.   When folded, the Metro Walker is about four times smaller than the average walker. It fits in small spaces like the overhead bin on an airplane or a tiny car trunk. The unique design allows it to open and fold up effortlessly.  To fold, just raise the easy-release lever with one hand and the walker collapses. To open, slide the handles apart.    The Metro Walker is lightweight but sturdy and strong, supporting up to 250 lbs. The innovative height adjustment feature adjusts to accommodate users from 4' 10" to 6' 8" with ease. You’ll also appreciate the 4" urethane front wheels and rear easy-glide feet, all contributing to ease of maneuverability.

10	|	Description	|	The Elasto-Gel Cervical Therapy Collar is designed to provide moist heat therapy or soothing cold therapy for relief from the pain of minor muscular and soft tissue cervical injuries, soreness and stiffness. The hot or cold therapy pack will retain the temperature for 20 to 40 minutes. This neck brace is made of a tough, flexible gel that will not leak, even if punctured. The gel wrap is covered with a four-way stretch material which allows maximum conformity and comfort.  For moist heat treatment, heat the neck collar in the microwave or a conventional oven. Simply heat the pack according to the included directions. When a warm wrap is applied, heat quickly penetrates muscles and joints. For cold therapy, place the wrap in the freezer. The wrap will remain soft and flexible at temperatures as low a - 20 degrees F. Usually the cold wrap will numb the treated area within 5 minutes without the harsh shock and pain that is sometimes experienced with ice or ice water treatments.

10	|	Description	|	Clinically tested Thermoskin® therapeutic elastic supports provide compression while helping to control arthritis swelling and aiding in the stability of the hand and wrist.  Thermoskin® supports are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® stabilizes the hand and wrist and combines compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.  Unique to Thermoskin® elastic supports is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® supports with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear.  Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while  helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin patients experience less pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly. The arthritis wraps are designed with an adjustable hook and loop closure to allow arthritis sufferers ease of use and compression variation. Hand washable.  Thermoskin Arthritis Hand and Wrist Support wrap around design is easier to put on.   Measure around wrist below crease.  Item is non returnable.

10	|	Description	|	The Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Glove helps Prevent Wrist Movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Comfortable, firm support for weak, injured or aching wrists. Helps prevent and provide relief of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Added benefit of heat therapy. Relieves pain and inflammation. Anatomically conforming fit and shape allows full use of fingers. Outer layer of fabric is textured to provide additional grip to aid in daily living activities. Metal splint positioned at 25 degrees helps prevent wrist movements that can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Fully adjustable velcro locking straps adjusts for a better fit.  Thermoskin Thermal Supports contain the exclusive patented Trioxon lining that has been clinically proven to increase your surface and subcutaneous skin temperature 2 to 3° F. This helps increase the elasticity of muscles, tendons, and ligaments to reduce the risk of injury when under stress. Thermoskin Thermal Supports also increase the blood flow to damaged tissue to help speed up the healing process, while providing light compression to counteract tissue swelling. The spiral structure of the Trioxon lining creates a micro-climate which allows the skin to ventilate by wicking away moisture and does not close the pores of the skin. You can wear Thermoskin for extended periods of time without the discomfort you would have with other products. Competitive products trap the perspiration resulting in discomfort, risk of infection and unpleasant odor.  In a recent study Thermoskin Thermal Supports provided “Considerable Relief” or “Total Relief” of pain in 83% of patients.  Measure the circumference of the hand around the knuckles.

10	|	Description	|	Clinically tested Thermoskin® therapeutic Arthritic Gloves provide compression while helping to control swelling and aiding in the stability of hands and fingers. Thermoskin® arthritis gloves are made from elasticized fabrics specifically designed to provide even compression and firm support for muscle injury and soreness, with the greatest possible comfort and fit. Thermoskin® arthritic gloves stabilize the hand and fingers and combine compression with naturally generated body heat for therapeutic relief from soreness and discomfort.  Unique to Thermoskin® Arthritis Gloves is Trioxon® - a unique soft material which not only captures and retains your natural body heat, but also, unlike other products, it allows your skin to ventilate and remain comfortably dry. Thermoskin® arthritis gloves with Trioxon® lining are completely washable and “breathable” to help alleviate excessive perspiration, skin irritations and the unpleasant odor associated with neoprene products. Anatomically shaped supports are very comfortable to wear.  Thermoskin out performs other products because the unique Trioxon lining is designed to be soft against the skin. This minimizes skin irritation and perspiration while helping to retain heat. With Thermoskin arthritis gloves, patients experience less hand and finger pain and mastery of rehabilitation protocols is facilitated. Thermoskin heat retainers will enable the return to routine activity more quickly. The arthritis wraps are designed with an adjustable hook and loop closure to allow arthritis sufferers ease of use and compression variation.   Hand washable. Item is non returnable. Thermoskin Arthritis Gloves are specifically designed to relieve arthritis pain in the fingers and hand. Outer layer is textured to provide extra grip. Anatomically shaped and secured with a hook-and-loop fastening. Measure around the hand at the base of the fingers. Sold in pairs.

10	|	Description	|	The Freedom Wand is a self wipe, sanitary, easy to use, multipurpose, portable, personal toilet tissue aid. It's specifically designed for personal cleaning and hygiene for anyone with limited mobility.  The Freedom Wand™ comes in three pieces, the handle, the extension and the head. Use the Freedom Wand™ with the handle and head for a total of 14 inches in length or add the extension for 21 inches. Because it's made from a polypropylene material, the freedom wand is very durable and easy to clean.  The Head:  The head is 9 inches long and has a slight curve to it to allow for proper reach. The head also has four "fingers" that extend out of the wand with the slide of a button. As they extend, they open to hold a shaver, sponge, ointment pad, tissue wad or other items.  When sliding the button back, the fingers go back into the wand, securing it in place and giving a tight grip, strength and a smooth end. To release an item, just push and slide the button back. It is that easy! The rinse hold in the head helps aid with cleaning in case any soil should get in the wand.  The Extension:  The extension is a 6½ inch piece. When combined with the head and the handle, the wand becomes 21 inches long. If a shorter wand is desired, the head and the handle can be put together without the extension for a length of 14 inches. Both the extension and the handle have quick and easy release buttons.  The Handle:  The handle is approximately 8 inches long. It is contoured for ease in holding and has a soft secure grip to eliminate slipping. It also has a loop on the end so that you can hang it in a convenient spot.  This is a non-returnable hygiene item.			Freedom Wand - multipurpose, portable, personal hygiene aid. Specifications:									Length:		up to 21 inches.							Material:		polypropylene.

The handle is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in your hand, so most aches and pains are eliminated.  The hanging hook is invaluable in keeping your work clean.  Because the brush is of such fine quality it performs delicate tasks as well as swift broad coverage with ease.

The Right Brush allows your wrist to be in a more “neutral” position allowing the stronger arm and shoulder muscles to be employed. This places less stress on the many small joints and muscles of the hand, wrist and forearm."  Joy Twelves, Physical Therapist  The Right Brush is a professional tool made with the finest push-chisel Polyester-Nylon bristles and stainless steel ferrule. The white polypropylene handle cleans up very nicely.  Available in 2 1/2” angle cut.

10	|	Description	|	Adaptive Flat Pads are 100% smooth Akton Polymer.  Adaptive Pads have multifunctional applications for traditional and non-traditional seating challenges.  Pads can be cut and used for spot protection on products, such as arm pads, foot plates, head rests, leg rests, and splints or braces.  Adaptive Pads are available in 1/4 inch 1/2 inch and 5/8 inch thicknesses.  The Adaptive Pad when used as a cushion is intended for comfort only, not medical intervention.  AKTON polymer won't leak, flow, or bottom out, and it is tissue equivalent. It moves with wheelchair users, not against them, to reduce pressure and shear, the two leading causes of pressure sores. AKTON polymer is also radiolucent and easy to clean with standard disinfectant. It will not support microbiological growth, and it won't absorb body fluids or odors.  Please note:  If 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch pad is used for a seating cushion, pad must be used with an Action brand cover for warranty to be in force.  Choose from the following models: Adaptive Pad 16 x 16 x 1/2 inch #CAC5302 Adaptive Pad 18 x 16 x 1/2 inch #CAC5303 Adaptive Pad 18 x 18 x 1/2 inch #CAC541818 Adaptive Pad 20 x 20 x 1/2 inch #CAC6500  Choose Optional Basic Cover, or no cover option. The Basic Cover is made of a durable stretch knit material which is essential to utilize the protective cushion properties.

10	|	Description	|	Akton Mattress Overlays are made of 100% Akton Polymer.  These mattress overlays are used to cover the entire surface or isolated areas of an existing standard mattress.  Used by hospitals and long term care facilities as a significant component in prevention and treatment of decubitus ulcers.  Akton Polymer will not migrate like gels, does not promote bacterial growth, and is ideal for multiple client use.  Akton 5/8 inch Full Mattress Overlays provide high pressure and shear reduction that requires no pumps, electricity or special training to use. The 5/8 inch layer of AKTON polymer can be used under clients with existing decubitus ulcers and increases bed surface height only 5/8 inch, providing for independent stable transfers.  Some models are available with a hook and loop hitch used to secure one end of the overlay to the head of the bed. The hitch will reduce slippage when the bed is raised.  Choose from the following sizes: Mattress Overlay Pad #CAC6300 27 x 46 x 7/8 inches Full Mattress Overlay #CAC6301 27 x 80 x 5/8 inches Large Mattress Overlay #CAC6302 35 x 80 x 5/8 inches Full Mattress Overlay #CAC6303 27 x 74 x 5/8 inches  Shipping via UPS Ground.  **This is a non-returnable hygiene item.

10	|	Description	|	The Pilot Flotation Pad with Basic Cover is a low profile cushion that provides exceptional pressure relief for most users with a pressure ulcer history. One full inch of Akton Polymer provides immersion for bony prominences and protects clients with fragile skin integrity.   This multi-use cushion is recommended for use on manual and power wheelchairs, truck or taxi seats, or for other uses requiring significantly reduced high-pressure areas, vibration and shear. The low profile allows users to effectively reach the floor for more efficient foot-assisted propulsion. It also conforms to pre-contoured foam or rigid cushions to maximize stability and positioning when required.  The Basic Cover is sold with the Pilot Flotation Pad. The Basic Cover is made of a durable stretch knit material. Soft black pontae fabric, non skid bottom, zippered on 3 sides, removable and washable. An Incontinence Cover is available for an additional charge.  (You can order the Incontinence Cover instead of OR in addition to the Basic Cover.)

AKTON polymer is also radiolucent and easy to clean with standard disinfectant. It will not support microbiological growth, and it won't absorb body fluids or odors.  The Shear Smart Cover is sold with the Shear Smart Pad. Provides significant relief from the effects of shearing and is an effective moisture barrier against incontinence. It offers a complete double layer of low shear material to allow for maximum movement on the pad.  Replacement covers are available.  Shipping via UPS Ground.  This is a non-returnable hygiene item.

10	|	Description	|	For everyone whose parents or other loved ones are aging, 50 Ways to Love Your Mother will help you find just the right gift to make their lives a little bit brighter. This treasure-trove of more than fifty practical ideas and thoughtful gifts also brims with Jane’s collection of resource discoveries—including company names, phone numbers and Web sites.   As an added bonus, Jane has included a list of books (bibliography) for those who want to learn more about caring for aging loved ones. Even professional caregivers will find these resources extremely helpful.   What Readers Are Saying  "I have seen this last part of life up close and personal as both a professional and as a family member. To be remembered is everything and more. This book can help you make that kind of difference to your family member." — Leigh Sereduck MSW, Dir. Social Services, Trinity Mission Health & Rehab Center / former Hospice Social Worker, Clinton , Mississippi   Baby Boomers Love This Book!  As many baby boomers reach fifty-something and beyond, their parents are beginning to move from the spaciousness of the family home into senior housing, assisted living or even care centers. Wouldn't it be great if we could make the transition just a little less difficult for them?

10	|	Description	|	The Tri-Core Orthopedic Cervical Support Pillow is prized for its effectiveness in correctly aligning the spine and supporting the neck in its natural position to help relieve headaches, neck pain for side and back sleepers alike. Its patented overall design: a unique trapezoid center and two neck lobes which cushion the head and support the neck, make it the highest quality cervical support pillow available.  Health care professionals recommend the Tri-Core pillow to reduce neck pain and instability, treat a wide variety of neck injury symptoms, and provide a consistently better night’s sleep.  Sleeping with your head on the Tri-Core might also help alleviate airway blockages, a major cause of snoring.  Most Tri-Core users experience an increase in sleeping comfort within a couple of days of using the orthopedic pillow. Others may require up to two weeks before the neck and back muscles adjust to their proper position.

10	|	Description	|	The Sip-Tip Cup makes drinking easier with the simple built-in one-way straw! The Sip Tip Valve is placed in the bottom of a clear flexible straw, which is placed in the specially designed clear plastic cup and flexible lid.  When the plastic lid is pressed or when the person takes a sip, the liquid moves up the straw.  The Sip-Tip Valve keeps the straw full of liquid. It reduces the amount of energy needed to bring liquid to the mouth, coughing and choking, and less air is swallowed. Provides a moderate restriction, giving the user greater control of the liquid flow. The Sip Tip works with most drinking straws and all parts (tumbler, lid and valve) are dishwasher safe.  People who are particularly frail and find it difficult to generate and maintain suction benefit from the Sip-Tip.  Sip Tip Cup includes: 1 unbreakable 8 oz tumbler, 1 spill resistant lid, 1 Sip-Tip Valve, 10 clear flexible straws.  			Sip-Tip Cup Specifications:									Tumbler:		8 oz.

This fire extinguisher is disguised as a compact easy to use aerosol can and is a great, low cost way to protect yourself from a tragic fire. Cooking mishaps are the leading cause of fires in the home, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Traditional fire extinguishers are large, heavy, difficult to use, and often challenging for people with arthritis hands.    This single use fire suppressant is effective on most electric, grease, fabric and wood fires. Just pull the safety tab, aim and squeeze the trigger. Fire Gone Fire Extinguisher foam is biodegradable so it is easy to clean up and won’t damage surfaces.

10	|	Description	|	The Healthcraft SuperPole System is designed for those requiring assistance for standing, transferring, or moving in bed. This award winning modular support system provides support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. The SuperPole has a high quality gripping surface that is particularly helpful for people with limited hand strength. It is constructed of heavy gauge steel for unfailing, rigid support.  SuperPole is a secure modular support structure that can be installed in minutes between a floor and ceiling and is held by a jack-screw expansion. The screw expands the pole to create enough tension between the floor and ceiling to hold the pole securely. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevent marring of the ceiling or floor. Installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Foam hand grip provides a comfortable gripping surface, particularly useful for those with limited hand strength. Installs anywhere there is a floor and ceiling, placing transfer support directly where it is needed. Use it beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair.   Note: The SuperPole™ System should only be installed between floors and ceilings of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System™ should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings. Recommended weight limit 300lbs/136kg. All designs and specifications subject to change without notice. Made in Canada © 2007.

10	|	Description	|	The SuperPole System with SuperBar helps you transfer with a secure support rail always in front of you. Pull sideways on the SuperBar to help you stand. The SuperBar unlocks and pivots freely to move with you step by step. This device locks every 45 degrees for stability during standing and sitting transfers. Automatically locks when released preventing forward or lateral falls. Provides full support when making two or three step transfers.  The SuperPole System is an award winning modular support system providing support and balance assistance to those who need extra help transitioning from a seated position to a standing position. This floor to ceiling grab bar installs easily with no structural reinforcements needed. Rubber pads on the ceiling plate and the floor plate hold the transfer pole in place and prevents marring of the ceiling or floor.  The SuperBar is a 16 inch horizontal center extension that mounts easily to the SuperPole for additional assistance. The Super Pole with Super Bar can easily be installed beside a bed, bath, toilet or chair. This transfer system is more compact than a walker in small restricted areas such as washrooms, and is ideal for pivot transfers in narrow areas such as between bed and wall, narrow hallways, etc. In a shower, the Super Pole with Super Bar provides complete support for stepping over the tub wall without reaching for wall grab bars. The SuperBar can pivot away from shower curtains, allowing them to fully close during a shower. For toilet transfers, the SuperBar permits pulling up to standing and can provide leaning support while managing clothing.  Please note: The SuperPole System should only be installed between floors and ceiling of solid construction or injury may result. The SuperPole System should not be installed on loose floor coverings, in rooms with radiant ceiling heating, in mobile homes, or in suspended or angled ceilings.

10	|	Description	|	The KNORK® can be used as an eating aid for people with limited hand mobility, from temporary injuries to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis.  KNORK® looks like a normal eating utensil and attracts no attention when using it. People who would otherwise require that their food be cut for them-- or else limit their meal choices-- can gain increased independence by using the KNORK®.  Because of KNORK®’s rising popularity with people with arthritis, KNORK®s are slowly infiltrating hospital rehabilitation units and cafeterias across the country.  Unlike a knife, the knork cuts through food with a rocking motion which is facilitated by a finger platform on both sides of the handle. Knorks are symmetric and can be used by both left-handers and right-handers.

The KNORK® can be used as an eating aid for people with limited hand mobility, from temporary injuries to permanent conditions such as severe arthritis.

10	|	Description	|	The Blue Scooper Plate can help people with muscle control issues, hand ailments, severe arthritis or similar conditions enjoy dining again. All scooper plates have a slightly taller rim on one side that has a reverse curve. The curve helps in scooping food onto a utensil. As food is pushed into this curve, it naturally rolls back onto a spoon or fork. Higher edges around the rest of the plate help corral foods and reduce the opportunity for spills.  Scoop dishes are suitable for both adults and children. However, they are typically smaller than regular dinner plates, which is ideal for better portion size control. The Blue Scooper Dish is made of a darker blue plastic and the dark blue background provides high contrast for light color foods which may not be easily identified on white plates by persons with declining vision (a frequent occurrence with Alzheimer's patients).

The Silipos gel is also unique for containing a medical grade mineral oil which gradually releases from the gel onto the skin to moisturize the skin while protecting it.  This slip on elbow sleeve is also designed for olecranon bursa protection, lightweight elbow protection, or ulnar nerve protection. The elbow pad provides cushioning to help decrease arthritis elbow pain. The minimum sleeve circumference is about 9.5 inches. The gel elbow sleeve will stretch much larger, but measure your arm circumference to ensure it will not be too loose fitting. Measured flat, the sleeve is 5 3/4 inches wide and 8 inches long. Non returnable hygiene item.   	Silipos Moisturizing Gel Elbow Sleeve Specifications:	    Includes:  1 elbow sleeve.    Made: in USA.    Size:  one size fits most arms, left or right.

10	|	Description	|	The Leg Loop Leg Lift allows a person to safely and effectively reposition the leg and foot onto a footrest, a bed, into a car, etc. by providing a more secure grip than merely tugging on a piece of clothing.  The Leg Loop™ consists of two loops - a hand loop and a foot loop, one at each end of a rigid middle section.  The Leg Loop Leg Lift helps people with limited lower extremity strength lift the leg and foot. It is designed to help people who have medical conditions in which they either partially or completely lose the ability to independently move their leg. Paraplegia, hemiplegia, paraparesis, hip surgery, and knee surgery are fairly common examples.  The foot loop stays open until the strap is pulled and then conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable grip. Rigid middle section allows for easy maneuverability. Once pulled, the loop closes and conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable fit.  This, combined with the rigid middle section" he asserts "makes it easier to place on the foot than other leg lifts and reduces the risk of the foot falling out and becoming injured.  			Leg Loop Leg Lift Specifications:									Construction:		1 inch (2.54 cm) wide, high strength, nylon webbing.							Length:		36 inches (91.4 cm).

10	|	Description	|	The Easy Commode and Toilet Riser is an easy-to-use handicapped toilet riser that raises the commode without any of the hassles that those old raised toilet seats created. This is a toilet seat riser that you install only once and that blends in with the bathroom. It was created to solve the problems created by those old, clunky disabled toilet seats.  There have always been a range of handicapped and disabled toilet seats on the market. But until now, users of these toilet seat risers had to compromise their comfort and dignity. The old toilet seat risers were clunky, ugly and flimsy. They were unsanitary and hard to clean. And they were a pain to mount and remove after every use. In other words, there was plenty of room for improvement.  The Easy Toilet Riser requires little additional cleaning. But most importantly, the Toilet Riser™ won’t force you to change your bathroom experience.  There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You’ll get to use the same toilet you’re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser™ just boosts it a little higher.  The Easy Toilet Riser™ comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser™ ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs.  Non returnable if packaging is opened.   Commode and Toilet Riser Product Instructions 			Commode and Toilet Riser Specifications:									Dimensions:		21 ¼ inches long x 11 ½ inches  wide x 4 inches high.							Elevation:		4 inches.							Color:		white.							Includes:		Toilet Seat Riser, two (2) 6 inch long closet bolts, two (2) wax rings, one (1) extended water pipe, two (2) washers, two (2) nuts, installation manual.

10	|	Description	|	The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is designed for use by patients who are able to stand but cannot readily move their legs.  For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc.  An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way.  If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper.  The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper.  The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer.  After using the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents.  Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry.  The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc.  Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair:  The disc is "locked" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient.  The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer.  Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet:  Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers.  The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet.  Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed:  Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked.  (For better control and safety, always have the patient wear a transfer belt.  Safety Sure Transfer Disc weighs 2 pounds and is 12 inch thick. Weight limit 300 lbs.

10	|	Description	|	Winner of Best New Product, Medtrade West April 2001 Prescribed by Doctors & Recommended by Health professionals. Fits over 170 million vehicles in North America.  The HandyBar locks securely, and reliably, into position to help you get in to and out of a car. In addition, it is easy to insert and remove, it is strong, durable and affordable. The material is forged steel with corrosion resistant plating. At just 0.7 lb., and measuring approx. 9 in. long, the Handybar™ is sufficiently lightweight, and compact, for it to be carried around in a handbag or pack. The precisely shaped nose locks the Handybar™ securely into position with little effort and enables it to be removed just as easily. It is also cranked, or bent, over its length to enable it to be reversed to give just the right height and angle of grip for getting in and out of a vehicle. Smaller, more compact cars tend to be lower down, closer to the ground making it even more difficult to get in and out of them. Fortunately, the U-type striker plate is one of the most rugged components in a vehicle being designed to keep the door closed in the event of a side-impact crash. There is a striker on each of the door pillars enabling the Handybar™ to be used by both the driver and passengers.  Stainless steel bar with non-slip hand grip fits in space where car door latches. Provides secure assist in getting in and out of a car. Easy to store and carry. Includes seat belt cutter and side window breaker.  Weight limit 350 lbs.

10	|	Description	|	The NoRinse Peri-Wash is a gentle hygienic cleanser that you spray onto soiled areas or directly onto toilet paper before you wipe. Toilet tissue alone may not leave you feeling fresh and moist wipes are expensive! It soothes private parts and leaves them clean and odor-free. Plus, it's much more economical than disposable wipes!   The NoRinse Peri-Wash contains skin softeners and cleansers for a healthy clean. It has light, powdery fragrance to help you feel fresh. Use the NoRinse Peri-Wash gallon size to refill your 8 oz plastic pump bottle. All you need is a couple of pumps to dampen the tissue each time you wipe, so each bottle lasts a long time. For an even greener solution, spray this perineal cleanser directly onto soiled areas and clean them with a warm damp cloth. The NoRinse Peri-Wash is better than dry toilet paper alone. It freshens and leaves you clean and odor free!  Ingredients: Deionized water, triethanolamine lauryl sulphate, cocamidopropyl betaine, propylene glycol, aloe vera, vitamin E, fragrance, diazolidinyl urea, methylparaben, propyleparaben, citric acid.

10	|	Description	|	The Placard Hanger’s J-hook design fastens safely and securely to the neck of your rear-view mirror. That area is not even visible from the driver’s seat, and it is the main reason why parking tags often tear during the process. Simply hang your placard on the J-hook and GO, it’s that easy! Fits ANY vehicle!   Don’t you wish that parking tag of yours would just slip on and off your mirror as easy as a warm knife cuts butter? Well now, for less than the price of a coffee and donut, it can.   Invented by a handicapped placard owner who became very frustrated every time he tried to hang his parking tag from the mirror, this ingenious product has made life a lot easier for many people.   As you know, the mirror arm that these parking tags hang from cannot be seen from the driver’s seat. That means you have to lean forward, crank your head and neck and basically twist your body into positions it was never designed to be in just so you can see where to hang your tag.   You know what I’m talking about. It’s a real pain in the ‘you know what’.   Some folks are so bothered by the pain and struggle of hanging their placards, they just leave them up all the time. Maybe you know someone who drives around with their handicapped placard hanging off the mirror. Maybe you’ve even done it yourself.

Germs and bacteria thrive on the moist environment of a toothbrush, and leftover plaque and bacteria live long after you are finished brushing and rinsing your toothbrush. The powerful UV-C light eliminates 99% of germs and bacteria that cause colds and flu.   The automatic 6-minute sanitizing cycle begins the moment you place your toothbrush in the sanitizer after brushing. When it’s time to brush your teeth again, your toothbrush will have been sanitized. The sturdy case is perfect for traveling and keeps your toothbrush sanitized and germ-free. The Verilux CleanWave UV-C Portable Toothbrush Sanitizer uses the same advanced UV-C light technology used to sterilize hospital equipment for over 30 years.

This Wake Up Light aligns the body's circadian rhythms that regulate normal sleeping and waking patterns. Synchronized sleep and wake programs provide the body with cues to fall asleep naturally and wake refreshed and revitalized. Unlike the sudden jolt of an alarm clock, the natural sunrise of the Rise and Shine won't disrupt the stages of sleep.  The Sleep Mode feature simulates the setting of the sun by gradually dimming the light and allowing you to fall asleep gradually and peacefully. The Rise & Shine is a radio, natural alarm clock, dawn and dusk simulator and lamp that wake you gently just as nature intended. Choose from four sounds capes or your favorite FM radio station to accompany your wake-up program.

10	|	Description	|	The See 4 Safety Mobility Light provides users of walkers, canes and rollators with an easily attached automatic light source. The light turns itself on when in motion and when it senses a low level light environment. The "intelligent” light turns itself off after 30 seconds if there is no motion or when it senses a well-lit environment. The patented, hands-free, automatic illumination is the only personal visual aid that knows when to turn itself on and off.   Simply flip the on/off switch to the on position, clip the light to round tubing of a cane, walker or rollator and start moving. Three bright LED lights are powered by two AAA batteries (included). The light uses two sensors. First, a motion sensor determines movement. After 30 seconds of not being moved, the light turns off. Second, the light uses a lighting sensor to determine if it is in a low level light environment. Only when it is in a low light environment and in use will the light illuminate. Saves batteries and time. Choose the off setting position to turn the light off.  See 4 Safety Mobility Light Product Instructions 			See 4 Safety Mobility Light Specifications:									Includes: 		2 standard AAA batteries.							Length: 		7 ¾ inches.							Width: 		4 &#8541; inches.							Height: 		1 ½ inches. 							Warranty:		guaranteed to be free of manufacturing defects for a period of one year from date of purchase.  At our option, NEPA Partners LLC will repair or replace any unit found to be defective in materials or workmanship under normal use.  THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER BATTERIES.

10	|	Description	|	The Synergel Dimensions Gel Cushion is a uniquely designed water insoluble silicone gel pad  wheelchair seat cushion. The special shape of the gel allows air-flow to keep you cool and comfortable. Gel provides cushioning and protection from pressure. The gel distributes point pressure over a wide area thereby reducing the pressure per square inch, making you more comfortable.  Synergel is a proprietary silicone polymer that was designed to mimic the same physical characteristics as human fat tissue. This medical grade silicone gel will not dry out, rot,  flow or leak if cut or punctured. Dimensions gel provides protection from shearing and friction, is specifically designed to reduce pressure, impact, and vibration and remains pliable and soft when used in extreme temperatures. Because the gel does not absorb fluids, it is ideal for use in places where the pad might get wet. Unlike other gel pads, Synergel Dimensions Gel will not retain heat and is odorless.  	Synergel Dimensions Gel Cushion Specifications:   Material: Medical grade silicone gel.  Made in: USA.  Thickness: 1/2 inch.

10	|	Description	|	The Recliner Riser helps you stand safely from your recliner. When you stand from the typical recliner, it tilts forward, dropping the arms and seat of an already low chair by 3 - 4 inches. Simply raising the chair by 5 or 6 inches, necessary for independent standing, makes it dangerously unstable. Stander has developed a safe and easy solution! When Recliner Risers are installed, they raise a chair 1 ¾ inches and limit the forward tilt allowing an additional 3 - 4 inches of lift. The 4 - 6 total inches of extra support gives a weakened person a biomechanical advantage and enables them to stand on their own.   Recliner Risers attach quickly and easily to the wooden base of your favorite recliner. Our patented design raises your effective seat height 4 - 6 inches while only raising your chair 1 ¾ inches.			Recliner Riser Specifications:									Riser Dimensions:		1.75" high x 2.5" wide x 6" long.							Weight Capacity:		800 lbs (including furniture).							Includes:		four Recliner Risers, two Rocker Limiters, 16 screws, Velcro, and instruction manual.

10	|	Description	|	Dycem 8 inch Round Pads are great for holding things firmly and securely in place, allowing the elderly, arthritic and disabled to perform everyday tasks. The non-slip material grips on both sides to secure objects, and still removes easily. Non toxic non-slip mats can be used on tables or trays to keep plates, cutlery, cups, pens or pencils from rolling. Holds a plate, bowl or glass secure, as well as reduces spillages while enabling people to retain their independence by feeding themselves.   Mats are available in blue, red, and yellow. Color contrast is important for many partially sighted, elderly people because the contrast helps to make items easier to see against work surfaces. Placing a brightly colored Dycem mat under a bowl will help make it easier to see as well as making the bowl more stable. The Dycem yellow has been endorsed for visually impaired by the Royal National Institute of Blind People.  Dycem mats are ideal for one handed activities. When the pads become dirty and dusty, simply restore the non-slip properties by washing in warm soapy water and allowing to dry. Dycem non-slip mats are not effective when wet.

10	|	Description	|	Good Grips Utensils have a soft, cushion grip that keeps the utensil in the hand–even when wet! The large, easy-to-hold handles are made of a rubber-like material, with flexible ribbing that’s comfortable to hold and adapts to any grip. The Good Grips handle is so unique, it has a U.S. patent.   Each Good Grip stainless steel spoon and fork has a special twist built into the metal shaft that allows them to be adjusted to any angle. Bend for use with either the right or left hand. A great solution for persons who have had a stroke, and for those with arthritis, weak grasps, or limited arm movement. Good Grips utensils are dishwasher safe. These Good Grips Utensils are ideal for persons with arthritis, CVA, Parkinson's disease or neurological impairments.  The Good Grips Rocker Knife requires only minimal arm strength for cutting. An extended safety cap protects fingers while cutting.  The Good Grips Pediatric Spoon features a smaller, “kid-sized” bowl and handle. Unlike most pediatric spoon handles, which have a static, right-hand bend, the Good Grips® Pediatric Spoon can be bent to any angle for use in the right or left hand.

A single Elasto-Gel product serves for both hot and cold applications.  The Elasto-Gel Hot or Cold Therapy Mitten allows you to apply hot or cold therapy directly to the hand without being uncomfortable. This Wrist and Hand Heat or Ice Wrap is made of a tough, flexible gel covered with a four-way stretch material, which allows maximum conformity, heat transfer, and comfort. This single product serves both hot and cold therapy applications.   Cold: The wrap remains soft and flexible at temperatures as low as -20 degrees F. The cold wrap will usually numb the treated area within 5 minutes without the severe shock and pain experienced with ice or ice water treatments. The wraps will remain cold for 20 to 40 minutes.   Hot: Moist heat quickly penetrates muscles and joints when a warm wrap is applied. The wrap will continue to provide moist heat for 20 to 30 minutes before it will need to be reheated. Heat helps to restore flexibility and provides excellent therapy for minor injuries during, and after rehabilitation exercises.

10	|	Description	|	The unique shape of the Core C-PAP Pillow is designed to accommodate C-PAP masks, hoses and headgear. Core Products has developed this pillow with a quilted side panel which creates a distinct edge that does not collapse, allowing the c-pap mask to comfortably hang over the side of the pillow. The quilted gusset prevents pillow collapse. The Core CPAP Pillow is durable enough to support the head and neck without losing its loft, yet soft enough to sleep on all night.  This sleep apnea pillow also works well for oral or dental appliances, people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain, or during pregnancy. This pillow accommodates both left and right side sleeping. A fitted pillowcase is included.  The CPAP Pillow is available in 3 different side panel thicknesses. To choose correct size, measure the distance from your neck to the end of your shoulder:  For 4-6 inches choose the petite loft 3 inch height. For 6-7 inches choose the standard loft 4 inch height. For 8+ inches choose the high loft 5 inch height.  	 	 Core C-PAP Pillow Specifications:	  Pillow Material: Fiber.  Case Material: Cotton.		  Includes: one pillow and fitted pillowcase.  Dimensions: 19.75 inches wide, 14 inches long.  Made in: USA.   *Non-returnable hygiene item.

10	|	Description	|	The Silipos Achilles Heel Sleeve is recommended by medical professionals for people with Achilles tendonitis, bursitis, heel prominences, pump bumps or hardened heel skin. It helps to prevent discomfort caused by footwear and is an ideal recovery tool for heel and achilles tendon surgeries.   The Silipos Achilles Heel Sleeve protects the tender Achilles tendon area while slowly releasing medical grade mineral oil to help soften and moisturize your skin. This protective heel sleeve provides gentle compression and dissipation of pressure around and inflamed Achilles tendon. The soft conforming gel pad protects the posterior of the heel from pressure, impact, and friction.  The heel sleeve and gel pad does not create bulk in your shoe like a heel cup or heel insert. It is a lightweight, comfortable, toe-less sleeve that can be worn with casual, dress, and work shoes. The Silipos Gel contains a medical grade mineral oil which gradually diffuses onto the skin for continuous, soothing relief. It is naturally supple and moist, conforms to the contours of your skin, and stays in place so you can get around and resume your normal activities.   	 		 Silipos Achilles Heel Sleeve:	  Material: nylon, spandex.  Package: one heel sleeve.		  Made in: USA.
